‚è∫ Ollama is perfect! üéØ

  That completely changes the equation:
  - Zero setup - It's already running locally
  - No API keys - No cost or rate limit concerns
  - Multiple models - Can test the mandala architecture properly:
    - Alpha: llama2:13b or mixtral (larger models)
    - Beta: llama2:7b (standard)
    - Gamma: phi or tinyllama (smaller, faster)
    - Delta: tinyllama (tiny, fast)
  - Fast iteration - No network latency, instant responses
