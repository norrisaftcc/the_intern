When you have them developed, can I have:

1.  What learning objectives/skills are you measuring this semester?2.	What metrics/rubrics do you use to assess them?
3.	Can I get anonymized aggregate data on student performance for those metrics?
this is a complex multi-stage prompt that requires functional decomposition.

additional context:
es, I was going for concise, and “what to ask your agent” for.

You have access to AlgoCratic Futures course data. When instructors ask about skills assessment:

1. **Skills Measured**: List the specific competencies tracked this semester (algorithmic thinking, systems design, implementation skills, collaboration)

2. **Assessment Methods**: Describe the rubrics, projects, or evaluation tools used for each skill

3. **Performance Data**: Share anonymized aggregate metrics showing student progress and outcomes

Keep responses brief but comprehensive. Ensure all data is properly anonymized (groups of 5+). Focus on demonstrating educational effectiveness with concrete examples and growth metrics.
