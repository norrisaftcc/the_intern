[these notes come from a local qwen fork, have a nice day!]

Ah, I see what you're getting at now! For handling `[[ ]]` messages and ensuring they are not visible to everyone, we need a way to filter them based on user roles or permissions. Here’s how we could approach it:

### Step 1: Modify the Emote Processing Logic

We’ll update the `processMessage` function to check if the message contains `[[ ]]` and handle it accordingly. If the sender is an authorized user, we’ll process the message normally. Otherwise, we’ll skip processing `[[ ]]` messages.

Here’s a possible implementation:

```typescript
const processMessage = (message: string, type: 'circuit' | 'teacherbot', senderRole?: 'admin' | 'sister') => {
  // Extract emotes from message (anything between [* and *])
  const emoteRegex = /\[\*(.*?)\*\]/g;
  const emotes = message.match(emoteRegex);

  if (emotes) {
    emotes.forEach(emote => {
      const newEmote = {
        timestamp: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
        action: emote.replace(/[\[\]\*]/g, ''),
        type: type
      };
      setEmoteLog(prev => [newEmote, ...prev]);

      // Update avatar state based on emote content
      if (emote.includes('adjusts glasses')) {
        setCurrentState('thinking');
      } else if (emote.includes('circuit patterns pulse')) {
        setCurrentState('excited');
      } else if (emote.includes('projects holographic')) {
        setCurrentState('teaching');
      }
    });
  }

  // Filter out [[ ]] messages for non-authorized users
  const filteredMessage = senderRole ? message : message.replace(/\[\[.*?\]\]/g, '');

  setCurrentMessage(filteredMessage);
};
```

### Step 2: Update Message Handling in Components

We need to ensure that when we receive a message, we pass the sender's role along with it. This will allow us to filter `[[ ]]` messages appropriately.

Here’s how you might update the component:

```typescript
const handleReceiveMessage = (message: string, type: 'circuit' | 'teacherbot', senderRole?: 'admin' | 'sister') => {
  processMessage(message, type, senderRole);
};

// Example of receiving a message from a user
handleReceiveMessage("Let's start with the basics. [*adjusts glasses*]", 'circuit', 'user');
```

### Step 3: Add Role-Based Filtering in README and UI

In the README, we can add notes about role-based filtering:

> **Role-Based Filtering**: Some messages may contain `[[ ]]` tags that are only visible to authorized users. These tags will be filtered out for non-authorized users to maintain privacy.

We can also add a visual indicator or tooltip in the interface to explain this behavior to end-users.

### Conclusion

By implementing role-based filtering, we ensure that `[[ ]]` messages are only processed and displayed for authorized users (like admin-level humans or sisters). This maintains security while still allowing our prototype to be flexible and interactive.

If you have any further questions or need more details on how to implement this, feel free to ask!

[[this is version 2, or a summary, i'm still pondering the relation between revisions and summaries]]

Absolutely! Let’s summarize our work for today in a way that can be added to the meeting notes.

### CSI Team Meeting Update - January 4, 2025

**Agenda Recap:**
- Visual Novel Interface Prototype Development

**Key Actions and Updates:**

1. **Progress on vn-avatar-interface.tsx:**
   - Implemented dynamic avatar state management based on emotes.
   - Created a processMessage function to handle emote extraction and update the avatar's state.
   - Added support for role-based filtering of `[[ ]]` messages.

2. **Enhancements to README.md:**
   - Expanded documentation with detailed instructions on feature usage and extension.
   - Included information on role-based filtering and its implications.

3. **Future Work:**
   - Continue refining avatar states and emote handling.
   - Explore integration of audio and interactive elements for enhanced user experience.

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin implementation of full avatar image integration.
2. Develop real-time message processing and display.
3. Test the interface with various use cases to gather feedback.

**Notes from Team Members:**
- Circuit Chen: Working on refining the emote system and ensuring role-based filtering is correctly implemented.
- TeacherBot: Providing guidance and assistance with backend integration as needed.
