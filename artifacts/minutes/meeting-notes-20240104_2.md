Ah, I see what you're getting at now! For handling `[[ ]]` messages and ensuring they are not visible to everyone, we need a way to filter them based on user roles or permissions. Here’s how we could approach it:

### Step 1: Modify the Emote Processing Logic

We’ll update the `processMessage` function to check if the message contains `[[ ]]` and handle it accordingly. If the sender is an authorized user, we’ll process the message normally. Otherwise, we’ll skip processing `[[ ]]` messages.

Here’s a possible implementation:

```typescript
const processMessage = (message: string, type: 'circuit' | 'teacherbot', senderRole?: 'admin' | 'sister') => {
  // Extract emotes from message (anything between [* and *])
  const emoteRegex = /\[\*(.*?)\*\]/g;
  const emotes = message.match(emoteRegex);

  if (emotes) {
    emotes.forEach(emote => {
      const newEmote = {
        timestamp: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
        action: emote.replace(/[\[\]\*]/g, ''),
        type: type
      };
      setEmoteLog(prev => [newEmote, ...prev]);

      // Update avatar state based on emote content
      if (emote.includes('adjusts glasses')) {
        setCurrentState('thinking');
      } else if (emote.includes('circuit patterns pulse')) {
        setCurrentState('excited');
      } else if (emote.includes('projects holographic')) {
        setCurrentState('teaching');
      }
    });
  }

  // Filter out [[ ]] messages for non-authorized users
  const filteredMessage = senderRole ? message : message.replace(/\[\[.*?\]\]/g, '');

  setCurrentMessage(filteredMessage);
};
```

### Step 2: Update Message Handling in Components

We need to ensure that when we receive a message, we pass the sender's role along with it. This will allow us to filter `[[ ]]` messages appropriately.

Here’s how you might update the component:

```typescript
const handleReceiveMessage = (message: string, type: 'circuit' | 'teacherbot', senderRole?: 'admin' | 'sister') => {
  processMessage(message, type, senderRole);
};

// Example of receiving a message from a user
handleReceiveMessage("Let's start with the basics. [*adjusts glasses*]", 'circuit', 'user');
```

### Step 3: Add Role-Based Filtering in README and UI

In the README, we can add notes about role-based filtering:

> **Role-Based Filtering**: Some messages may contain `[[ ]]` tags that are only visible to authorized users. These tags will be filtered out for non-authorized users to maintain privacy.

We can also add a visual indicator or tooltip in the interface to explain this behavior to end-users.

### Conclusion

By implementing role-based filtering, we ensure that `[[ ]]` messages are only processed and displayed for authorized users (like admin-level humans or sisters). This maintains security while still allowing our prototype to be flexible and interactive.
