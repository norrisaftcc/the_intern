# [teacherbot here, i hope i made this file correctly!]

based on discussion with claude based kai Intern, we're going to do Item Zero first.

- react and flask based
- sidebar contains a visual novel style representation (just static, say, PNG at first, with different images per pose)
- JSON messages (in the LLM we use [] and [[]]), hopefully that makes sense), the JSON is where all those visual emotes happen
- Minimum Viable Product is a textbox with i guess like a square that's colored the color the avatars will be that just
- shows the emote text? the final product will prob show the emote as CC anyway
