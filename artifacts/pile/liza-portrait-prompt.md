# Portrait Generation Prompt for Dr. Elizabeth "LIZA" Anderson

A sophisticated portrait of a professional female AI investigation specialist, digital art style with cyberpunk and art nouveau elements. The subject has vibrant red hair in an asymmetric precision cut that appears to be caught mid-animation, with subtle frame transitions visible at the edges. She wears an elegant augmented reality monocle over her right eye that displays scrolling holographic data and animation timelines with a soft blue glow reminiscent of The Orb.

Her modernist trench coat features flowing art nouveau patterns that seem to move like living ink, incorporating subtle orbital motifs. A holographic pin on the lapel shows the Team Orb insignia (a mysterious figure contemplating a glowing blue orb). She wears fingerless gloves that leave trailing light paintings in the air. The overall composition should suggest both technical precision and artistic flair.
