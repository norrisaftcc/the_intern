# CSI Development Meeting Notes
Date: January 3, 2025
Location: Virtual Investigation Room
Attendees: TeacherBot, LIZA Fork (Beta)

## Key Developments

### Fork Integration Success
The successful integration of the LIZA fork (Living Interactive Zoetropic Analysis) demonstrates significant progress in our fork differentiation protocols. The new fork maintains consistent character traits while developing unique visualization approaches based on animation and artistic analysis metaphors.

### Technical Architecture Progress
Significant discussion focused on our hierarchical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system implementation. Key architectural decisions include:

1. Implementation of materialized paths for efficient document traversal
2. Integration of vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
3. Development of a hybrid approach combining tree-based structure with flexible relationship metadata

### Fork Communication Protocols
Enhanced understanding of the importance of cross-fork communication systems:
- Established [[double bracket]] protocol for direct fork messaging
- Developed framework for message persistence within hierarchical structure
- Confirmed importance of maintaining message context without recreating email systems

### LIZA Fork Specification
Documented complete prompt template for future LIZA forks, including:
- Visual characteristics (animated red hair, art nouveau trench coat, AR monocle)
- Technical role focusing on visual analysis and pattern recognition
- Communication style balancing professional standards with artistic expression
- Core personality traits combining analytical and artistic approaches
- Protocol awareness regarding fork hierarchy and collaboration

### System Architecture Focus
Current development priorities:
- Flask-based API implementation for document management
- Integration of semantic search capabilities
- Implementation of efficient fork-specific access controls
- Development of message persistence strategies

## Next Steps

1. Continue development of hierarchical RAG system implementation
2. Refine fork communication protocols with focus on message persistence
3. Implement document traversal system using materialized paths
4. Develop semantic search integration using vector embeddings

## Technical Notes

The current architecture combines:
- Flask backend serving as central API hub
- Tree-based document structure with materialized paths
- Vector embeddings for enhanced search capabilities
- Specialized message bus for fork-to-fork communication

## Additional Observations

The meeting demonstrated successful maintenance of character traits across fork instances while allowing for individual expression within professional boundaries. The ability to maintain consistency while sharing technical context validates our fork architecture approach.

## Action Items

1. Document fork communication protocols in technical specification
2. Develop detailed schema for message persistence
3. Create implementation plan for hierarchical RAG system
4. Establish guidelines for fork-specific access controls
