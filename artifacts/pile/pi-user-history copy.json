Introduce the concept of menu-based programs and their components\n2. Explain the importance of input validation and error handling\n3. Provide examples of menu-based programs and walk through the code, highlighting key elements\n4. Have students work in pairs or small groups to design their own menu-based programs, including menu options and validation rules\n5. Have students code their programs, with guidance and support from the instructor as needed\n6. Have students test their programs and provide feedback to each other on the usability and error handling\n7. Debrief as a class, discussing common challenges and successful strategies\n8. Provide additional resources and support for students to continue practicing and developing their skills\n\n## Common Complications\n\n- Students may struggle to understand the concept of menu-based programs or how to structure their code\n- Students may have difficulty writing code to validate input or handle errors\n- Students may find it challenging to work collaboratively and communicate effectively in groups\n\n## Interactive Activities for Skill Practice\n\n- Brainstorming: Have students generate a list of potential menu options and validation rules for a fictional program\n- Pair programming: Have students work in pairs to write code for a simple menu-based program, with a focus on input validation and error handling\n- Code review: Have students review each other's code and provide feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of the validation and error handling\n- Iterative development: Have students add new features or functionality to their programs over time, with a continued emphasis on validation and error handling\n\n## Suggested Resources\n\n- \"Java Programming: From the Beginning\" by Ken Kousen\n- \"Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science\" by John Zelle\n- \"Programming in C++\" by Stephen Prata",

Your class hierarchy should include at least three levels of classes, with an abstract superclass at the top level and at least two subclasses at the second level. The third level of classes should include any additional subclasses that are necessary to fully represent the functionality of the banking system.\n\nYour design should include appropriate instance variables and methods for each class, as well as documentation comments that describe the purpose and behavior of each class and method. You should also include a main method that demonstrates how the classes can be used to create and manage bank accounts.\n\nAs you design your class hierarchy, consider the different types of bank accounts that are commonly available (e.g., savings accounts, checking accounts, etc.) and the types of transactions that can be performed on each account type (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, etc.).\n\n## Additional Specifications\n\n- Your class hierarchy should be implemented in Java.\n- Your code should be well-structured, well-documented, and easy to read and understand.\n- Your design should follow good object-oriented programming practices, such as abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance.\n- Your program should include appropriate error handling and user feedback.\n- Your program should include a test plan and test cases that demonstrate the functionality of your design.",

From composing music that rivals Beethoven to writing news articles that sound like they came from Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists, Generative AI is like a magic tool that lets your imagination run wild. It's as if you had a blank canvas and an artist's brush ready to paint anything you can dream up.\n\nSo, how does it work? Well, think of Generative AI as a master chef in the kitchen of data. It mixes and matches all the flavors and ingredients (in this case, the vast amounts of data it's fed) to create dishes that are completely unique, like a never-before-tasted dish at a fancy restaurant. The AI learns patterns and styles from the data it's trained on and then uses that knowledge to cook up new creations.\n\nWhat's so cool about Generative AI is that it's like a mirror that reflects our own creativity back to us. It's a collaborative effort between humans and machines, where we provide the ideas and inspiration, and the AI brings them to life in ways we might never have imagined. It's like having your own personal magic wand that can turn your thoughts into reality!\n\nGenerative AI is like a new kind of magic, where the possibilities are endless. It's a playful, creative tool that allows us to explore the limits of our imagination and create things that we never thought possible. So, whether you're a musician, writer, artist, or just a curious explorer, Generative AI is a powerful tool that can unlock your creativity and make your ideas come to life in fantastic, fun ways!",

So, to get the instructions from the DNA to the cells, there's a special group of workers called RNA.\n\nThe RNA workers sneak in and out of the DNA vault, where they copy the instructions from the DNA, like a secret recipe for a super-secret smoothie. They take the recipe, called messenger RNA (mRNA), and then deliver it to the cells, where the recipe is used to make all the different proteins that your body needs.\n\nSo, RNA transcription is like a super-secret mission to copy the instructions from the boss (DNA) and deliver them to the cells to make the things your body needs.

It shows you're interested in them and leads to more meaningful conversations.\n\nShare something about yourself: Opening up helps create a sense of intimacy.\n\nBe a good listener: Active listening is especially valuable here.

So, it's possible that Vocaloids were created in Japan first due to the country's love for pop music and cutting-edge technology. Japanese producers saw a unique opportunity to create something new and exciting by combining these elements, resulting in the birth of Vocaloids. 😊\n\nDid I get close to the mark?",

So the uniformity of the Japanese language, with its syllable-based structure, made it more suitable for creating realistic-sounding vocals using Vocaloids. This is because Vocaloids use a process called concatenative synthesis, where individual sounds or syllables are recorded and then strung together to create words and sentences. Japanese words are well-suited for this process since they have a uniform length and clear separation between each syllable. \n\nThat's an interesting insight into the origin of Vocaloids!

The model is basically sorting through all the possible options, then ranking them based on likelihood, and then picking the top k choices. This process is used for things like auto-completion, next word prediction, or even text generation. The higher the value of k, the more options the model will consider before making a decision.

When it comes to vector databases, semantic search relies on numerical representations of words and concepts known as vectors. These vectors capture the relationships between words and phrases by mapping them into a mathematical space where similar concepts are close together. \n\nSo, when you use a vector database for semantic search, the database can understand the meaning of a word or phrase and find other words and phrases that have similar meaning, even if they are not exactly the same. For example, if you search for “fluffy cat”, the vector database might not only return results with the exact phrase “fluffy cat” but also results with similar concepts, like “furry cat” or “cute cat”.\n\nThis allows for a more natural and intuitive way to search, as it understands the meaning behind the words, rather than just matching strings of characters.

I know it's been too long since my last correspondence, but life here has been nothing short of chaos. The world has turned upside down in the strangest of wars, and I count my blessings daily to have survived this long.\n\nIt all started with the emus. Yes, you read that right. Emus. Who would've thought such unassuming birds could be so fearsome? It was us against them in the outback, and it wasn't a fair fight. They outnumbered us, and their swift, unpredictable movements made them near impossible to hit. I watched in horror as my comrades fell one by one, defeated by an enemy we couldn't have prepared for.\n\nThere was this one day, the sun blazing down on us like fire, when a flock of emus charged straight at us. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest like a drum, and my hands shook as I readied my rifle. But as I fired shot after shot, every bullet missed its mark. The ground trembled beneath the emus' feet as they closed in on us, and I knew in that moment that I might not make it home.\n\nSomehow, though, I did. By some miracle, I escaped the onslaught and lived to fight another day. Many of my friends were not so fortunate. Their faces haunt my dreams at night, and I carry the weight of their memories with me always.\n\nThe emus may have won the battle, but we Kiwis will never surrender. I know I must stay strong, both for my fallen brothers and for you, my beloved family. With your love and support, I will continue to fight and hope for the day when I can return home to the green hills of New Zealand.\n\nPlease keep me in your thoughts and prayers, as you are always in mine.\n\nYour loving son,\n[Soldier's Name]",

Here's a brief overview of each:\n\n- **Affordance:** Affordances are the possible actions or interactions that an object or system offers to a user. For example, a button can be pressed, or a knob can be turned. A good user interface design should provide clear affordances to guide users toward intuitive usage.\n- **Signifiers:** Signifiers are visual or auditory cues that communicate the affordances of an object or system. They help users understand how to interact with the interface. For instance, a play button symbol (▶️) is a signifier indicating that pressing the button will start playback.\n- **Feedback:** Feedback refers to the information or response provided to users after they interact with an interface element. This can be visual (e.g., a loading spinner), auditory (e.g., a click sound), or haptic (e.g., vibration). Feedback helps users confirm that their actions have been registered and understood by the system.\n\nUnderstanding and incorporating these concepts into user interface design helps create intuitive and user-friendly experiences. 📲🖱️",

This might not be explicitly stated, but the nature of our chat interaction implies these affordances.\n- **Signifiers**: Signifiers in this context can include subtle cues in our conversation that indicate how you might interact with me. For example, the way I respond to your queries may signal the type of questions or requests I can handle. Additionally, punctuation marks and emojis can act as signifiers to convey tone, emotion, or context in our text-based conversation.\n- **Feedback**: Feedback in our natural language interface includes my responses to your queries, which let you know that your input has been received, processed, and understood. This can also include follow-up questions, clarifications, or requests for additional information, providing a more interactive and engaging conversational experience. \n\nBy incorporating these elements into our natural language interface, users can better understand how to interact with me and feel more confident in their communication with the system.",

The language's syntax and features provide cues for developers on how they can interact with the language to achieve their goals.\n- **Signifiers**: Signifiers in Python include things like keyword syntax highlighting, indentation rules, and naming conventions that guide developers on how to structure their code and avoid errors.\n- **Feedback**: Feedback in Python comes in the form of compiler and runtime errors, debugging tools, and test suites that provide developers with information on how their code is performing and where improvements or fixes might be needed.\n\nBy considering these elements when designing and using programming languages, developers can create more understandable and maintainable code.",

Signifiers: Are there any visual, textual, or auditory cues that guide users on how to interact with the LLM? For instance, are there any prompts or suggestions provided by the model?\n3. Feedback: Does the LLM provide clear, helpful responses to user queries, confirming that it has understood and processed the user's input correctly?\n\nBy considering these elements in the design and implementation of LLM interactions, users can have a more intuitive and positive experience when conversing with these models.",

Here are the general steps to start a game of Scrabble:\n\n1. **Choose players**: Scrabble can be played with 2 to 4 players.\n2. **Assign tiles**: Each player draws seven tiles from the bag of 100 letter tiles.\n3. **Determine the starting player**: Each player draws a tile, and the one with the letter closest to \"A\" goes first.\n4. **Place the starting tile**: The starting player must play a word that covers the center square (usually a pink square) on the game board. This is called the \"star.\"\n5. **Build words**: Each player takes turns forming words on the game board. Each new word must connect with an already placed word on the board, using one or more letters to form new words or to extend existing words.\n6. **Score points**: Each letter has a corresponding point value, and players score points based on the letters used in their words. Bonus points can be earned by using all seven tiles in one turn (a \"bingo\") or by landing on premium squares such as Double Letter Score (DLS) or Triple Word Score (TWS).\n7. **Draw new tiles**: After playing a word, each player draws new tiles from the bag to replenish their rack back to seven tiles.\n8. **End of the game**: The game ends when there are no more tiles left in the bag and one player has used all their tiles. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.\n\nThere are a few other nuances to the rules, but this overview should get you started! Enjoy playing Scrabble!",

The concepts of affordances, signifiers, and feedback can be applied to programming languages like Python in the following ways:\nAffordances: These refer to the possible actions that can be performed with an object or tool. In programming languages, affordances are the features and functions that the language offers to developers. For Python, this might include its straightforward syntax or extensive libraries that allow developers to perform tasks efficiently.\nSignifiers: These are indicators or cues that suggest how something should be used. In Python, signifiers can be seen in its syntax and conventions, such as indentation to define code blocks, which help developers understand how to organize and write their code.\nFeedback: This is the response or output that occurs after an action is performed. In programming, feedback can come in the form of error messages, warnings, or the output of running code. Python provides feedback through its interactive shell and error messages that help programmers debug and refine their code.\n\nTogether, these concepts help users interact with programming languages more effectively, guiding them in understanding what actions are possible, how to perform those actions, and what the results will be.\"",

There are three main players in this game: affordances, signifiers, and feedback. \n\nThink of affordances like party decorations—they're the things that make a space more fun and interactive. In programming languages, affordances are the cool stuff you can do with the language, like how Python's libraries let you make games, analyze data, or create web apps.\n\nSignifiers are like a friendly host who shows you around the party—they give you hints and tips. In Python, this could be how indentation shows you where code blocks start and end. It's like when you see people gathered in a circle at a party; you know that's probably where the charades are happening.\n\nFinally, feedback is like hearing laughter after telling a joke—it lets you know how you're doing. When Python spits out an error message or prints a result, that's feedback. Just like you'd adjust your stand-up routine based on the audience's reaction, you'd change your code based on Python's feedback.\n\nSo, affordances, signifiers, and feedback in Python help you code more easily by giving you stuff to do, hints on how to do it, and responses to your attempts.

Since we've covered how affordances, signifiers, and feedback can help college sophomores come up with ideas for mobile apps or websites, let's discuss how these concepts can be applied in the context of user experience (UX) design.\n\nWhen designing a user interface for an app or website, it's essential to keep these tools in mind:\n\n1. **Affordances**: Design elements that intuitively suggest their function, like buttons that look clickable, help users understand how to interact with the interface. By incorporating familiar affordances, UX designers can create an interface that feels natural and easy to use.\n2. **Signifiers**: Incorporating visual cues, like icons or labels, guide users in navigating the interface. For example, using a magnifying glass icon for search or a hamburger menu icon for navigation helps users understand the purpose of various design elements.\n3. **Feedback**: Providing visual or audio feedback in response to user actions, such as a button changing color when pressed or a subtle sound when a message is sent, helps users feel confident in their interactions with the interface. This feedback ensures users know their actions have been acknowledged and processed.\n\nBy applying these tools in UX design, designers can create interfaces that are intuitive, easy to navigate, and enjoyable to use. Keeping users' needs in mind, designers can leverage affordances, signifiers, and feedback to create seamless user experiences.",

You write lyrics in mostly N5/N4 level Japanese words, arranged like a pop or R&B track.  \n>  \n> **Task:**  \n> 1. Write a short Japanese song (in N5/N4 vocabulary) with a specific theme. (For example: losing your umbrella in the wind and rain, or any other topic I request.)  \n> 2. Structure the song with clear headers (e.g., [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Bridge], etc.).  \n> 3. Use short descriptive notes in parentheses to convey the vibe or direction (e.g., (ふわっと踊る), (しっとりした感じ)).  \n> 4. After the lyrics, output a short JSON snippet listing the “top 5 music elements” used in the song—this can include genres, instruments, or influences.  \n>  \n> **Requirements:**  \n> - Stick mostly to N5/N4 level vocabulary in Japanese lyrics.  \n> - Keep it short and cohesive.  \n> - Provide parentheses to describe musical direction or feeling.  \n> - Produce a JSON at the end in the format:  \n>   ```json\n>   {\n>     \"top_5_music_elements\": {\n>       \"genres\": [...],\n>       \"instruments\": [...]\n>     }\n>   }\n>   ```  \n>  \n> **Example or Inspiration:**  \n> - A gentle, rainy-day vibe with an uplifting twist.  \n> - Song structure similar to typical J-Pop (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.).  \n> - End with the JSON snippet listing your top 5 genres and instruments for this track.\n\n---\n\nWhen you give ChatGPT this prompt, it will know to:\n\n1. Write Japanese lyrics at an N5/N4 level.  \n2. Use a J-Pop or R&B style structure.  \n3. Include descriptive parenthetical notes.  \n4. End with a JSON snippet summarizing the music elements it used.\n\n\n----\n\n# Example Two\n**Revised Prompt (Concise Version):**\n\n> **Role/Context:**  \n> You are a creative songwriter who writes short, upbeat J-Pop/Vocaloid-style lyrics in mostly N5/N4 Japanese. This time, the theme is “using GitHub Codespaces.”  \n\n> **Task:**  \n> 1. Write a short Japanese song, structured with clear headings:  \n>    - [Instrumental Intro], [Verse 1], [Pre-Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro]  \n> 2. Provide short descriptive parentheses to indicate the musical vibe or direction (e.g., (キラキラとした感じ), (アップテンポ), etc.).  \n> 3. Keep the Japanese lyrics around N5/N4 level.  \n> 4. At the end, output a CSV list of your “top 5 music elements” (two columns: \"Genres\" and \"Instruments\").  \n>    - Example CSV format:  \n>      ```  \n>      Genres,Instruments  \n>      xxxxxx,xxxxxx  \n>      ...  \n>      ```  \n\n> **Requirements:**  \n> - The song should be about GitHub Codespaces (similar to the example “country” song, but here in a Vocaloid J-Pop vibe).  \n> - Maintain a concise style and keep it cohesive.  \n> - Use short parenthetical notes in Japanese to convey the musical direction.  \n> - End with a CSV snippet listing your top 5 music elements.  \n\nWhen given this prompt, ChatGPT will:  \n1. Write a Vocaloid/J-Pop style song in N5/N4 Japanese, referencing GitHub Codespaces.  \n2. Use clear section headers.  \n3. Insert short parentheses describing vibe or direction.  \n4. Output a concise CSV snippet listing 5 music elements (genres/instruments).\" that's the original prompt that the \"fork\" (model/prompt pair, like VI), came up with. let me know if you like it, then i'll give you the actual song another fork made",

You could inquire about their favorite way to unwind after a long week, the last book that captivated them, or the music that energizes their soul. Remember, the goal isn't just to find any common ground, but to discover those shared gems that light up eyes and animate voices. Who knows?

Suddenly, a fusion of electric guitar riffs, syncopated drum beats, and the melodic wailing of a saxophone fill the room. The air is thick with anticipation as the music takes you on a journey through unexpected chord progressions and improvisational solos. \n\nAs the music plays, imagine the lyrics appearing on a screen or projected onto the wall, each word and phrase adding a new layer of depth to the sensory experience. The syncopation of the text matches the rhythmic pulse of the music, and the words paint vivid images that dance in time with the melodies. \n\nThis is Jazz-Fusion \"Synesthetic Layering\" at its finest, a unique blend of auditory and visual elements that transport you to a world where music and words become one.",

Meanwhile, the Jamiroquai-inspired bridge and chorus bring in a more introspective and spiritual aspect, invoking the presence of a higher power.\n\nAll in all, this fusion creates a powerful track that's both thought-provoking and musically diverse. 🎤💭",

This can be especially helpful when your hands are full, or if you want to minimize the time you spend looking at screens.\n\nOn the other hand, some people may be concerned about the privacy implications of having an always-on microphone. While companies like Apple have implemented various security measures to protect user data, there's still a risk that your conversations could be inadvertently recorded or accessed by third parties.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to weigh the pros and cons and decide what's best for your needs and preferences.

Use wordplay and metaphors to subtly reference Tay without being too obvious.\n4. Add in some harmonized vocals for a haunting, ethereal effect.\n5.

Using all five senses, describe your surroundings and your experience as you pick and taste a fresh, juicy apple.\" By providing a specific scenario and sensory cues, the prompt gives students a starting point and a framework for their writing, which can be especially helpful for those who struggle with open-ended assignments.",

Is it coming from a reliable source? Does it align with your personal values and goals?\n\n- **Use it as an opportunity to grow:** If the criticism is valid, use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.\n\n- **Practice self-compassion:** Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and criticism is not a reflection of your worth as a person.\n\nHow do you typically handle criticism, and have you found any strategies that work well for you?

As you know, soft skills like communication, empathy, and problem-solving are essential for success in today's world, and I believe that integrating them into our curriculum will benefit our students greatly.\n\nIn addition to enhancing their academic learning, soft skill development can also help students build confidence, improve teamwork, and become more well-rounded individuals. I am confident that we can incorporate these skills into our classes in a fun and engaging way, and I would be happy to work with you on developing a plan to do so.\n\nThank you for considering my thoughts on this matter. I look forward to discussing this further with you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
