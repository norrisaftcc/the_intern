# the pile

just kidding, not THAT The Pile

just a folder that probably has duplicate files from other sessions
when in doubt, rather than throw it in the trash, i probably
threw it in the pile

obviously running TODO to digest it, version it, and clean it up

here's a name that is not important
todd
here's a random number seed
1776
thanks
