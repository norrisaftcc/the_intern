**Summary of known facts:**  
- The original lyrics are rap-style, referencing GitHub, sign-ups, repos, commits, and collaboration.  
- We need to rewrite them in a **country and western** style, maintaining a similar structure (Hook, Verse 1, Verse 2, etc.).  
- We’ll keep the essence but shift the language and imagery to evoke a country feel.  
- Finally, we’ll provide a short list of style descriptors in parentheses, separated by commas.

## Country & Western Version

[Hook: Gentle guitar picking, warm vocals – easy-going rhythm] 
GitHub’s our frontier, where dreams come alive  
Sign in, saddle up, let that repo thrive  
(Repo thrivin’… thrivin’… thrivin’…)

[Verse 1: Unhurried, storytelling tone] 
I moseyed on in, typed GitHub in my bar  
Clicked “Sign Up” real easy, reachin’ out so far  
Wrote my name, my pass, my email down  
Had to prove I’m not a bot in this code-lovin’ town  
Checked my mail for a note, said “Welcome aboard!”  
Now I’m ready to ride, code is my reward  
Picked my own settings, made ‘em fit just right  
In this brand-new corral, my repos shine at night  

**[Mid-verse pickup]**  
Up top’s a plus sign, “New Repository” calls  
I’ll name it plain, so folks can heed its drawl  
Could open it wide so the whole wide world can see  
Or keep it under wraps, just between code and me  
Drop a README in there, set the stage, tell my tale  
Maybe toss in a license so the rules don’t fail  
I click “Create” with pride, see that project stand  
Got my boots in the dust, building dreams on this land  

**[Slower, reflective]**  
Now… I can upload new files or craft ‘em right here  
Drag ‘em in or type away, my path is clear  
Down at these crossroads, my code rests up high  
Each commit’s a footstep, under that big prairie sky  


**[Hook]**  
GitHub’s our frontier, where dreams come alive  
Sign in, saddle up, let that repo thrive  
(Repo thrivin’… thrivin’… thrivin’…)

**[Verse 2: Steady, conversational pace]**  
Got GitHub Desktop loaded, ready for the ride  
Sign back in, keep my code workin’ side by side  
Clone that repo down: “File” > “Clone,” well alright  
My local stable’s filled with code, ropin’ it in tight  

**[Mid-verse burst]**  
I open that folder, line by line, watch it beam  
Commit to main, push it up, part of the team  
One button, one push, and the dream’s in the air  
Cowboyin’ this code with folks everywhere

**[Slow, heavy emphasis]**  
Yes… we… build… with a big ol’ honest heart  
Sharin’ knowledge across these plains is a mighty fine start  
GitHub’s our station, we all ride that track  
Projects rollin’ onward, never lookin’ back  

**[Building speed]**  
From sign-up to repos, from push to success  
Four simple steps, no need to stress  
No matter how grand the plan, the proof’s in the code  
Your story’s right there, ready to lighten your load

**[Hook]**  
GitHub’s our frontier, where dreams come alive  
Sign in, saddle up, let that repo thrive  
(Repo thrivin’… thrivin’… thrivin’…)

**[Outro: Soft guitar fade]**
