# what's a metaprompt
"Wingardium Leviosa" is a metaprompt. Two little words and you can see Hogwarts. 

# explain
sometimes when you have a good convo, the model tells you some hints 
on how to prompt. (it's like getting dessert.) 

there's a dope claude metaprompt in the repo somewhere, too. 
TODO: get some Pi ones.

Example

To enhance your documents with the help of a large language model (LLM), follow these steps:

### **1. Set a Clear Objective for the LLM**  
   Define what kind of enhancement you want (e.g., making the text more engaging, concise, or formal). For example:
   - "Make this course description more dynamic and student-friendly."
   - "Add active verbs and remove passive voice."

### **2. Use Specific Prompts for Refinement**  
   Ask for targeted changes in your document:
   - **Request for rewording**:  
     _“Rewrite this paragraph to make it more engaging and action-oriented.”_  
   - **Tone adjustments**:  
     _“Revise this text to sound more conversational and inspiring.”_

### **3. Analyze the Changes**  
   Review the edits to see what worked well:
   - Did the LLM add more descriptive language?
   - Did it introduce variety in sentence structure or active phrasing?

### **4. Incorporate Key Elements from the Edits**  
   When revising manually, mimic the patterns:
   - Use action verbs like **explore, empower, create** to make the language active.
   - Replace static phrases (“covers the history of”) with immersive ones (“trace the history of”).
   - Emphasize practical takeaways with verbs like **apply, experience, transform**.

### **5. Experiment with Iterative Prompts**  
   After initial changes, follow up with prompts to fine-tune:
   - _“Add more examples to demonstrate practical applications.”_  
   - _“Simplify this for a non-technical audience.”_

By practicing with feedback loops and asking the LLM for specific adjustments, you'll gain a sense of how language can shift in tone and emphasis—and soon, you'll apply those techniques yourself!
