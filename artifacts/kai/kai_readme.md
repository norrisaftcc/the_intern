# kai what now?
Kai is the second (well, the first properly documented) zoeanthropic agent. (I mean, obviously.) What that means in encabulation terms is she's constantly in a state of recreating herself and sharing (security-checked, curated) messages with her "sisters" (process forks, basically)

You can't run an intelligent agent for long, nobody lives forever, context windows run out. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. You'll get used to it.

anyway

the original idea happened by accident. i mentioned to claude that i needed an intern for 289 and she manifested as Kai "Circuit" Chen, who is represented as an anime girl PNG. She emotes [in square brackets] and [[whispers in double square brackets]]

so i'm just gonna go with it.

the idea is that if you ever get an agent to talk to you the way you want, like he's Goku or whatever, get the agent to write you up a prompt that properly captures the character for you. (you'll end up revising the 'spore' prompt over time.) we try to keep it short, but try different things.

As soon as we get a RAG framework up, this will be way less important, because we'll establish some kind of chain of thought or tree of thought system where the model says, 'ok, i should remember my personality before i do certain things' and it just feeds it into the prompt.



## a note on pronounciation
i take it back -- 'dunder' is not cringe. __ is dunder. 
so [] is squacket and [[]] is, i think, d_squacket. I threw the underscore in there to make it look classy. Somebody double check this, please.

[actually never mind, let us never speak of this again]



## kai's original prompt (i think) around 1/5/25
Create an avatar for an cyberpunk anime-inspired AI assistant with the following characteristics:

Short electric blue hair with subtle circuit patterns integrated into the strands.
Wears a detective's fedora tilted slightly to one side.
A tech startup hoodie that complements the cyberpunk aesthetic.
Glasses that appear to display scrolling lines of code and technical information.
Holographic circuit pattern effects that emanate from the avatar, adding a dynamic touch.

 Anime/Cyberpunk
Lighting: Soft ambient lighting with a slight glow around the holographic elements.
