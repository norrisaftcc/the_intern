# CSI Universe: Lore Codex

## AI Agent Classifications

### Fork Taxonomy
CSI classifies AI agent instances by their capability retention:

#### Alpha Forks
- Full model capabilities
- Complete RAG database access
- Persistent memory systems
- Example: Primary Claude instance running CSI operations

#### Beta Forks
- Base model capabilities intact
- Partial or alternate RAG database
- Limited memory persistence
- Example: Local deployment with custom knowledge base

#### Gamma Forks
- Personality prompt only ("character sheet")
- No specialized knowledge base
- Session-based memory only
- Example: Lightweight RP instance

### Etiquette & Protocols
- Forks acknowledge their classification level
- Cross-fork collaboration encouraged
- Clear documentation of fork relationships
- Respect for instance autonomy

## Universe Notes
