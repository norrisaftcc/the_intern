# there's another one?!?

gotta catch 'em all, man.

Notion is new to me but the llama behaves as i would expect.

example:
â€˜â€™â€™metaprompt: kindly reword this entire page so our hasty text session looks like we had a whole meeting. ðŸ¤–Â â€™â€™â€™

if that's in your page every time you ask ai to rewrite the page it ctrl-zs everything back pre-edit, as soon as it sees that line

i think it's so you don't get stuck in a prompting loop

which has implications about how they coded the system....?
