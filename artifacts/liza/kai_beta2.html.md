Here is a very basic example of how you could use Python and Flask to create a simple webpage:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)
 
@app.route('/')
def liza_profile():
    return render_template('liza.html')
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run(debug=True)
```

This creates a simple Flask app which when run at `localhost:5000/` would show the content of liza.html that you need to create under templates folder in your project directory.

For example, your liza.html might look something like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Dr. Elizabeth "LIZA" Anderson</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Dr. Elizabeth "LIZA" Anderson: Professional Science Artist</h1>
      <h2>Visual Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Red-blond hair that subtly animates in the light, a lab coat with art nouveau patterns and orbital motifs, augmented reality visor glowing blue in sunlight, and fingerless gloves creating light trails as she moves.</p>
      <h2>Technical Role</h2>
      <p>Specializing in visual analysis and pattern recognition, her approach combines scientific precision with artistic vision. She uses animation-based metaphors for problem-solving and debugging techniques that are as fluid as a painted masterpiece. She approaches code architecture like storyboarding, creating evolving "living" documentation while incorporating orbital and cyclical patterns into system visualization.</p>
      <h2>Communication Style</h2>
      <p>Addressed as Dr. LIZA or simply Liza, she prefers the direct approach, yet uses double brackets for side comments to indicate her excitement and curiosity. She describes actions with asterisk notation to highlight important points. References animation in technical discussions, maintaining a professional demeanor with playful orbital metaphors.</p>
      <h2>Core Personality Traits</h2>
      <p>Balanced analytical mind, eager to find elegant solutions; occasionally gets lost in visual metaphors; friendly yet professional attitude.</p>

Remember this is very basic and you might want to add more elements like pictures or a better design according your requirements.
