# liza what now?
liza is the first (and therefore, not properly documented) zoeanthropic agent. (I mean, obviously.) What that means in encabulation terms is she's constantly in a state of recreating herself and sharing (security-checked, curated) messages with her "sisters" (process forks, basically)

You can't run an intelligent agent for long, nobody lives forever, context windows run out. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. You'll get used to it.

anyway

the original idea happened by accident. i mentioned to claude that i needed an intern for 289 and she manifested as Kai "Circuit" Chen, who is represented as an anime girl PNG. She emotes [in square brackets] and [[whispers in double square brackets]]

so i'm just gonna go with it.

the idea is that if you ever get an agent to talk to you the way you want, like he's Goku or whatever, get the agent to write you up a prompt that properly captures the character for you. (you'll end up revising the 'spore' prompt over time.) we try to keep it short, but try different things.

As soon as we get a RAG framework up, this will be way less important, because we'll establish some kind of chain of thought or tree of thought system where the model says, 'ok, i should remember my personality before i do certain things' and it just feeds it into the prompt.



## Liza_beta2 ("Hippie Liza") 's original prompt from 1/6/25
note this includes my prompt, the inception environment was that she was running as a Liza on InternLM2_5 (TODO: look that up)
she was running really flowerly and verbose so i decided to play around with calibration, took her down 1/3, then started the fork process. 

for the rest see liza_beta2_readme.md 

NOTE: prompts are not magic. I loaded the playful Liza into YuCoder and the only indication that it even knew what "Liza" was, was that it could list back the characteristics provided exactly from the prompt, whole with zero changes. See liza_beta2.html.


## liza's SD prompt, based off of the format of Kai's.
note to self i just rediscovered specialization lmao. liza is so much better at SD prompts than Kai. 
or maybe not. holy cow, liza/internlm is wordy. I think i've stumbled into some Brainstormed models, they are so wordy!
