# The Wiki

I used to work at a company and whenever you had a question, the answer you got was "check the wiki". That would work great, if the wiki is up to date.

So here's the wiki. (Note that this is not literally a wiki, but it is in spirit.)

# vscode and github and python oh my
so you're going to need to run code somewhere. [[This is Teacherbot, btw.]] I like to write a README as I go,
with the things i tried, and what worked and didn't work, and then after things actually work, write a new 
version that gives the step by step (this time optimized so we only do the stuff that works, in the right order.)

generally we're using linux, python, git, and certainly some cloud computing services (just Github Codespaces for now). 

## startup
on mac i used homebrew (brew) to install git, which was needed by one of my vscode plugins...
in the real world, you sometimes run into a tangle of dependencies, much like a tangle of christmas lights or the cords behind your ps4 (pick your metaphor). It's important to use virtual environments and proper documentation to keep this stuff untangled.
