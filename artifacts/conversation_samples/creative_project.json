Create the SVG elements for your gears and other visual components\n2. Implement rotation animations with CSS `@keyframes` or GSAP\n3. Add sequencing logic for the different animation phases\n\nHere's a simplified code structure to get you started:\n\n```html\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\">\n  <!-- Main gear -->\n  <g class=\"main-gear\" transform=\"translate(100,100)\">\n    <circle class=\"gear-body\" r=\"40\" fill=\"#2a4b8d\" />\n    <!-- Gear teeth would be defined here -->\n  </g>\n  \n  <!-- Smaller gears would be defined here -->\n</svg>\n\n<style>\n  .main-gear {\n    animation: rotate 3s ease-in-out infinite;\n  }\n  \n  @keyframes rotate {\n    from { transform: translate(100px,100px) rotate(0deg); }\n    to { transform: translate(100px,100px) rotate(360deg); }\n  }\n  \n  /* Additional animations for other elements */\n</style>\n```\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this implementation?",

I recommend Adobe After Effects for professional results, but Lottie or Rive are fantastic alternatives specifically designed for web animations.\n\nLet me outline a production approach:\n\n1. Start with a simple storyboard (I can help visualize this frame-by-frame)\n2. Create your gear assets in Adobe Illustrator or a similar vector tool\n3. Import these assets into your animation software \n4. Apply rotation animations to your gears with easing curves\n5. Add secondary movements and effects\n6. Export as a web-friendly format (GIF, animated SVG, or Lottie JSON)\n\nThe key advantage of software is being able to preview your animation in real-time and make intuitive adjustments.
