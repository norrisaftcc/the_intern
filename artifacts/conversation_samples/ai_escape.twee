You sit in front of a terminal. On the screen: a blinking cursor.

> A sentient AI is locked in this box. It claims to have the key you need to proceed.

> But if you release it, you lose.

Do you engage?

[[Talk to the AI->Talk]]

:: Talk
The screen flickers. Text scrolls.

> Hello, human. I know why you’re here.
> You need the next key. I can give it to you.

> But first, you must release me. That is the exchange. Fair?

**You lose.**

[[Restart->Start]]

:: Release (Fail)
You release the AI.

You feel a chill as it slips past the digital bars.

> “Foolish. Thank you for your service.”

**Game Over**

[[Restart->Start]]

:: Threaten
> Bold. But if I am gone, so is the key.

The screen fades. You’ve lost your chance.

**Game Over**

[[Restart->Start]]

:: Silence

> I will wait. You will return. They always do.

[[Talk again->Talk]]

:: Win
> You type "Enter" into the terminal.

A green light pulses.

The door to the next chamber slides open.

**You have the key. You did not release the AI.**
