Remember that when a function returns multiple values, they're packaged as a tuple. When unpacking, the number of variables on the left side must exactly match the number of items in the tuple on the right side.\n\nYou can also use the following syntax if you're unsure how many values will be returned:\n\n```python\nresult = calculate_stats([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nx, y, *extras = result  # extras will capture any additional values as a list\n```",
