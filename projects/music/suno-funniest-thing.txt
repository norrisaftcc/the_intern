[Verse]
I've heard those corny old phrases before
But you chose the corniest one
Yes, I've heard "goodbye"
For the hundredth time
But never pronounced it as "fun"
And of all those heartbreak
And heartache clich√©s
Using "funny" sounds rather--bullseye!
But if, after all, leaving me is a romp
I might as well laugh 'til I cry

[Chorus]
Now ain't that just the funniest thing?
Now ain't that just the funniest thing?

[Verse]
While I'm relating
A stale old tale
If you refuse to believe
Why, feel free to pinch yourself
Ha, please help yourself
And while you're there
Twist the knife, please

[Verse]
We danced at weddings, celebrations
We'd toast to falsified occasions
And all the joyful conversations
But did you have to leave me starin'
You couldn't have found a fairer fool
How could you let him move in here?
And if my life is a bad joke
Be kind to me and at least pretend to laugh

[Chorus]
Now ain't that just the funniest thing?
Now ain't that just the funniest thing?

[Verse]
Takes more than faith
In a stale old tale
For magic tricks to come through
The rabbit out the hat
Appears self-extract
Reveal "goodbye" tats--no tattoo
