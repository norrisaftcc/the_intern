# Translated Song

[Intro]

[Verse]
In the night, eyes awaken  
Dreams warm and glowing  
A sky full of stars  
Folded into my palms  

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow hides on my forehead  
Blended with returning dreams  
Open the door and look outside  
Books carried away by the wind  

[Chorus]
That girl who turned her heart into a sky of stars  
Always the heroine in someoneâ€™s dream  
Shining over farmland, taking flight  
Without brushing against any familiar faces  

[Verse 3]
When I blinked, I saw  
A silhouette so peaceful  
In an old painting  
I searched for that vanished face  

[Bridge]
If I stand alone and think of today  
Lost between cold and warmth  
Stars that have fallen below  
Like dreams without a lifespan  

[Verse 4]
By the time I awake, the voices will shift  
Reading the story she once told  
They hide within the pages of a book  
Like a supernova that never fades  

[Outro]
