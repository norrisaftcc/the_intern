[Hook: Soul chipmunk sample with echoing vocals - steady, melodic]
Time slips through my fingers like grains in the glass
While memories fade into photographs
(Into photographs....... photographs...)
[Verse 1: Building speed gradually]
Seven years old, watching shadows dance on my wall
Time was this giant / that I couldn't make fall >
Now I'm watching / my father's hair fade in the light >
Time's a thief that moves silent / stealing colors in the night
[Quick double-time flow]
Remember when summers stretched out like highways
Now years fold like origami, disappearing sideways
Used to count days till Christmas, now I count grey hairs
Life's like wet paint dripping down time's twisted stairs
[Slowing, more deliberate]
Found... my old toys in the attic... covered in dust
Metal cars all rusted... childhood dreams gone to rust
[Speeding up]
But what hit harder than seeing those forgotten things was
catching my reflection in a mirror with broken wings >
[Punchy, staccato delivery]
Now I under/stand why mama /kept those photo /books
Each page a /butterfly trapped in /amber, precious /looks
[Flowing, liquid delivery]
Time was an ocean back then, now it's just a stream
Running faster than my legs can carry these dreams
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Conversational pace with bursts]
Looking through my phone at faces growing old
Friends I used to know, stories left untold >
[Quick burst]
Their kids growing like weeds in fast-forward scenes while my
memories of them stay frozen in their teens
[Rhythmic, measured pace]
Started counting backwards / from milestones ahead /
Now I'm counting forward / from the moments that fled /
Strange how time bends / around the pain in our mind /
Some scars take decades / while some heal right behind
[Slow, heavy emphasis]
Got... this... watch... from my grandfather's trembling hands
He said "Time's not money, son... time's grains of sand"
[Building speed]
Now I'm older than he was when he told me that truth
Watching my own hands shake > holding fragments of youth >
[Flowing]
Calendar pages falling like autumn leaves...
Each season teaching lessons that nobody believes...
Till you're standing in December looking back at May...
Wondering how whole lifetimes fit into one day...
[Hook]
