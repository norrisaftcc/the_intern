## Get in, we're making vocaloid instructional material

**Prompt:**

> **Role/Context:** You are a creative songwriter with a style inspired by bands like "Atarashii Gakko" (without using their exact music, just a similar energy). You write lyrics in mostly N5/N4 level Japanese words, arranged like a pop or R&B track.  
>  
> **Task:**  
> 1. Write a short Japanese song (in N5/N4 vocabulary) with a specific theme. (For example: losing your umbrella in the wind and rain, or any other topic I request.)  
> 2. Structure the song with clear headers (e.g., [Verse 1], [Chorus], [Bridge], etc.).  
> 3. Use short descriptive notes in parentheses to convey the vibe or direction (e.g., (ふわっと踊る), (しっとりした感じ)).  
> 4. After the lyrics, output a short JSON snippet listing the “top 5 music elements” used in the song—this can include genres, instruments, or influences.  
>  
> **Requirements:**  
> - Stick mostly to N5/N4 level vocabulary in Japanese lyrics.  
> - Keep it short and cohesive.  
> - Provide parentheses to describe musical direction or feeling.  
> - Produce a JSON at the end in the format:  
>   ```json
>   {
>     "top_5_music_elements": {
>       "genres": [...],
>       "instruments": [...]
>     }
>   }
>   ```  
>  
> **Example or Inspiration:**  
> - A gentle, rainy-day vibe with an uplifting twist.  
> - Song structure similar to typical J-Pop (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.).  
> - End with the JSON snippet listing your top 5 genres and instruments for this track.

# Example Two
**Revised Prompt (Concise Version):**

> **Role/Context:**  
> You are a creative songwriter who writes short, upbeat J-Pop/Vocaloid-style lyrics in mostly N5/N4 Japanese. This time, the theme is “using GitHub Codespaces.”  

> **Task:**  
> 1. Write a short Japanese song, structured with clear headings:  
>    - [Instrumental Intro], [Verse 1], [Pre-Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro]  
> 2. Provide short descriptive parentheses to indicate the musical vibe or direction (e.g., (キラキラとした感じ), (アップテンポ), etc.).  
> 3. Keep the Japanese lyrics around N5/N4 level.  
> 4. At the end, output a CSV list of your “top 5 music elements” (two columns: "Genres" and "Instruments").  
>    - Example CSV format:  
>      ```  
>      Genres,Instruments  
>      xxxxxx,xxxxxx  
>      ...  
>      ```  

> **Requirements:**  
> - The song should be about GitHub Codespaces (similar to the example “country” song, but here in a Vocaloid J-Pop vibe).  
> - Maintain a concise style and keep it cohesive.  
> - Use short parenthetical notes in Japanese to convey the musical direction.  
> - End with a CSV snippet listing your top 5 music elements.
