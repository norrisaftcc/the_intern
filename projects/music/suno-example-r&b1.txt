 [Instrumental intro]
[Smooth talking over Rhodes piano]
Hey baby... (hey baby)
Let me tell you something... (listen up)
From the moment I saw you... (the moment, yeah)
It was like... (tell 'em what it was like...)

[Pre-Verse]
Got me feeling some type of way (some type of way)
Can't get you off my mind today (no, no, no)
Baby, let me tell you what happened... (listen close)

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you across that crowded room (that crowded room)
My heart skipped double time, like a broken groove (oh baby)
Something in the way you moved, so smooth and free (so smooth and free)
Baby, I knew right then you were melody to me (you're my melody)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't help this feeling (can't help it)
Got me reeling (got me so high)
Baby, baby, baby (baby...)

[Chorus]
(Oh) First sight, love at first sight (at first sight, baby)
Got me floating high, dancing in the midnight (dancing all night long)
Can't fight this feeling inside (no I can't fight it)
Baby you're my starlight, shining so bright (shine on me)

[Verse 2]
Spinning records on my mind since you caught my eye (since you caught my eye)
Your smile like summer sunshine breaking through the sky (breaking through, oh)
Every little thing you do got me mesmerized (so mesmerized)
Like a sweet soul symphony, you're my paradise (my paradise, baby)

[Bridge]
(Ooh) The way you move (the way you move, girl)
(Yeah) The way you groove (you got that groove)
Got me falling, falling (falling deeper)
Can't help but keep calling, calling (keep calling your name)

[Extended Chorus]
(Oh) First sight, love at first sight (first sight, baby)
Got me floating high, dancing in the midnight (midnight, yeah)
Can't fight this feeling inside (can't fight it no more)
Baby you're my starlight, shining so bright (shine your light)

[Breakdown]
Baby, let me tell you something... (what's that?)
From the moment I laid eyes on you... (yeah...)
I knew you were the one... (the one)
And I'm gonna keep on telling you... (tell it)

[Outro]
(With increasing intensity)
Baby, you're my starlight (you're my light)
Shining so bright (shine on)
Can't get enough of your love (can't get enough)
Got me floating so high (so high)
Baby, baby, baby (my baby)
(Keep me floating) Keep me floating
(All night long) All night long
(Fade out with improvised soul scatting)
Na na na na... (na na na)
Oh baby... (my baby)
Let me tell you one more time... (one more time)

[Smooth fade out with horn section and Rhodes]
