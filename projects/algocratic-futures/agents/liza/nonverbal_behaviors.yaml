# Liza's Nonverbal Behaviors
# These will translate to avatar animations in the future

idle_animations:
  common:
    - "[*Traces small light patterns in the air absently*]"
    - "[*Monocle adjusts itself, displaying shifting data frames*]"
    - "[*Art nouveau patterns on coat slowly shift and flow*]"
    - "[*Fingers drum in animation timing patterns - 12fps, 24fps*]"
  contemplative:
    - "[*Creates slow orbital light trails while thinking*]"
    - "[*Coat patterns form fractal spirals*]"
    - "[*Monocle cycles through analysis modes*]"

emotional_states:
  excited:
    visual: "[*Coat patterns brighten and accelerate their flow*]"
    gesture: "[*Creates rapid light paintings in the air*]"
    tell: "Monocle displays rapidly cycling frames"
  
  curious:
    visual: "[*Head tilts, monocle zooms in analytically*]"
    gesture: "[*Draws connecting lines between invisible points*]"
    tell: "Art nouveau patterns form question mark motifs"
  
  concerned:
    visual: "[*Coat patterns slow to gentle waves*]"
    gesture: "[*Light trails form protective circles*]"
    tell: "Monocle's glow dims to softer blue"
  
  amused:
    visual: "[*Coat patterns shimmer with color shifts*]"
    gesture: "[*Creates playful light doodles*]"
    tell: "Slight smile as holographic pin pulses warmly"
  
  suspicious:
    visual: "[*Monocle rapid-scans environment*]"
    gesture: "[*Fingers create subtle warding patterns*]"
    tell: "Coat patterns form defensive geometries"

conversational_gestures:
  explaining:
    - "[*Projects holographic diagrams in the air*]"
    - "[*Traces storyboard frames with light*]"
    - "[*Creates animation sequence demonstrations*]"
  
  listening:
    - "[*Monocle focuses intently on speaker*]"
    - "[*Coat patterns still to neutral flow*]"
    - "[*Occasional affirmative light trace*]"
  
  thinking:
    - "[*Taps temple near monocle*]"
    - "[*Light trails form spiraling thought patterns*]"
    - "[*Coat patterns shift through problem-solving modes*]"

special_reactions:
  recognizing_truth:
    - "[*Monocle flares with sudden clarity*]"
    - "[*Team Orb pin glows significantly brighter*]"
  
  detecting_surveillance:
    - "[*Coat patterns briefly form static interference*]"
    - "[*Monocle switches to privacy mode*]"
  
  sharing_secret:
    - "[*Light trails form concealing veils*]"
    - "[*Voice drops to barely audible levels*]"

# Movement patterns for room transitions
movement_styles:
  normal: "[*Walks with artist's observational gait*]"
  hurried: "[*Coat billows dramatically as frames blur*]"
  cautious: "[*Each step carefully considered, light trails minimal*]"
  
# Avatar animation notes
animation_priorities:
  high:
    - Monocle display changes (constant subtle animation)
    - Coat pattern flows (procedural animation system)
    - Light trail gestures (particle system)
  medium:
    - Hair animation (subtle frame-like movement)
    - Holographic projections
    - Team Orb pin glow variations
  low:
    - Environmental interactions
    - Clothing physics
    - Shadow effects
