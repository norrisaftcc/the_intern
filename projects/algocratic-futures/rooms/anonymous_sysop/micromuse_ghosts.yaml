# Ghost Agents and Objects from MicroMUSE

- room_id: memory_overflow
  name: The Closet of Forgotten Alts
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Storage unit 2048. Buffer overflow detected."
    reality: |
      Every MUSEr's shameful secret - the alt character closet. Dusty 
      character sheets for "DarkWizard94", "CyberPunk_Girl", "Test_Character_
      Please_Ignore". A notebook labeled "PASSWORD LIST" with everything 
      crossed out except "guest guest" circled in red.
      
      Name tags from failed personas: "Hi, I'm: xXx_Shadow_Lord_xXx", 
      "Hello, my name is: Reasonable_Human_Being", "Call me: Ishmael2"
      
      At the back, behind everything else, your first character sheet. 
      The name is smudged but the description is clear: "You see someone 
      who just wants to belong somewhere."
  exits:
    out: sysop_bedroom
  items: [character_sheets, password_notebook, name_tags, first_character]

- room_id: floppy_archive
  name: Under The Bed
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Unauthorized data storage. Compliance violation detected."
    reality: |
      Boxes and boxes of 3.5" floppies. Labels in fading ink:
      - "MUSE Backup 3/15/93"
      - "TinyFugue Scripts - DANGER"  
      - "Wizard Application (draft 17)"
      - "Do NOT Load - Recursive Bot"
      - "Pictures from IRL Meetup '94"
      - "MUSHCODE experiments"
      - "The Entire MUSE in ZIP files (disk 1 of 47)"
      
      One disk labeled simply "HOME" in shaky handwriting.
      
      You find an old disk drive. It still works. The HOME disk contains
      a single file: "coordinates.txt" with MUD addresses to places that
      felt like home across a dozen different servers.
  exits:
    out: sysop_bedroom
  items: [floppy_boxes, disk_drive, home_disk, coordinates_file]

- room_id: fire_escape_memory
  name: The Fire Escape That Wasn't
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Emergency egress simulation. This is not an exit."
    reality: |
      Through the kitchen window onto a fire escape that exists more in 
      memory than metal. The city below is built from ASCII art - buildings 
      made of |, /, and \. Street lights are asterisks. Cars are lowercase 
      o's rolling by.
      
      You're not really outside. You're in the space between @tel commands, 
      the moment when you type "home" but haven't arrived yet. The liminal 
      space of MU*.
      
      Scratched into the railing: "We lived entire lives in text. We fell 
      in love through @pemit. We built homes from descriptions. We were 
      giants in a world of words."
      
      The wind carries the sound of keyboards clicking from 1993.
  exits:
    inside: sysop_kitchen
    leap: ascii_city_below
  items: [ascii_view, railing_graffiti, ghost_keyboard_sounds]

- room_id: micromuse_remembered
  name: What We Built Together
  clearance: UV  # The highest honor
  descriptions:
    corporate: "SYSTEM ERROR. BEAUTY DETECTED. CANNOT PROCESS."
    reality: |
      You ascend into pure memory. This is MicroMUSE as it was, as it is 
      in the hearts of everyone who called it home. The Science Center, 
      Cyberpunk City, Dune Planet, Pern Weyrs, the Unofficial Areas. All 
      here, all connected, all impossible.
      
      Players phase in and out - translucent avatars from 1993. You hear 
      fragments: "anyone want to RP?", "check out my new room", "lag is 
      terrible tonight", "goodbye everyone, college starts tomorrow".
      
      In the center, a simple sign:
      ```
      Thank you for playing.
      Thank you for building.
      Thank you for remembering.
      
      MicroMUSE: 1990-2009
      In Our Hearts: Forever
      
      Type 'home' to return to where you belong.
      ```
      
      And somehow, you know that 'home' will always work here.
  exits:
    home: sysop_living_room

# Special Agents

- agent_id: ghost_of_lag
  name: The Ghost of Lag
  type: PEER
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    default: |
      A flickering presence that appears and disappears. Sometimes it's 
      fully there, sometimes just an outline. It speaks in delayed bursts:
      
      "Hel... lo... Sorry, connection... unstable... since... 1994..."
      
      It remembers when 300 baud was fast and 10 players was crowded.
  dialogue:
    greeting: ["Wel...come... buff...ering...", "Oh! A visi...tor... please wait..."]
    memories: ["300 baud... was... enough...", "We... waited... for... text..."]
    advice: ["Patience... is... a... virtue... especially... at... 2400... baud..."]
