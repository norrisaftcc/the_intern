      A door that shouldn't exist, tucked between two storm drain pipes. 
      The brass nameplate reads "apt #define HOME 127.0.0.1". Someone has 
      scratched "est. 1993" below it. The door is slightly ajar, and you 
      hear the faint sound of a 14.4k modem handshake from within. A sticky 
      note says "If you remember MicroMUSE, come in. -Anonymous"

    reality: |
      A meticulous recreation of a 1990s sysop's apartment. CRT monitors 
      glow on every surface - an SGI Indigo, several VT100 terminals, and 
      a Mac SE/30 running NCSA Telnet. Cables everywhere. A bookshelf holds 
      O'Reilly books with animal covers, "The Whole Internet User's Guide", 
      and printed MUD maps. A beanbag chair has a permanent body impression.
      
      A handwritten note: "Rebuilt from memory and archived @descs. Some 
      details fuzzy after 30 years. The feeling remains perfect. -A"
      
      The west wall has postcards from MUSErs worldwide - Melbourne, 
      Stockholm, Tokyo. Someone was very connected, once.

  descriptions:
    corporate: "Nutritional preparation area. Efficiency suboptimal."
    reality: |
      A 90s apartment kitchen, barely touched. The fridge hums with the 
      sound of an old Seagate drive. Inside: Mountain Dew, leftover pizza, 
      and film canisters (labeled "NOT FILM - BACKUP TAPES"). The microwave 
      clock blinks 12:00. Always has, always will.
      
      Coffee maker surrounded by stained mugs with tech conference logos: 
      "USENIX '92", "DEF CON 1.0", "MicroMUSE Gathering '94 - You Had To 
      Be There". One mug has a wizard hat drawn in sharpie.

  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Unauthorized dormancy zone. Productivity loss detected."
    reality: |
      A futon on the floor, never made. More important: the three computers 
      that never sleep. One shows eternal scrolling text - a MicroMUSE 
      connection that refuses to timeout. "Guest3 has connected" repeats 
      endlessly. Another runs pine, 50,000 unread emails.
      
      The closet door is covered in dot matrix printouts of memorable MUD 
      moments - "@toaded griefers", first successful TinyMUSH compile, the 
      Great Lag of '94. A calendar on the wall is stuck on March 1993.
      
      Under the bed: boxes of 3.5" floppies labeled "MUSE BACKUP", 
      "IMPORTANT", and mysteriously, "DO NOT LOAD".

    reality: |
      This is where life happened. A massive desk built from a door and 
      cinderblocks. The main terminal - a beautiful amber phosphor display - 
      shows a MicroMUSE wizard session frozen in time:
      
      ```
      #define NOSTALGIA 
      @desc here=A place that exists in the space between memory and code.
      > @pemit/contents here=Time passes. Nothing changes. Everything changes.
      ```
      
      Ethernet cables snake through holes drilled in the apartment walls. 
      One is labeled "To MIT", another "To Reality (broken)". Post-it 
      notes cover every surface with IP addresses, MUD commands, and one 
      that just says "REMEMBER TO SLEEP" in faded ink.
      
      A photo taped to the monitor: pixelated faces at a MUD gathering, 
      everyone making wizard hand gestures. You can't make out features, 
      but the joy is clear.

    reality: |
      Down a ladder through the floor (how is this possible in an apartment?) 
      into what should be the apartment below, but isn't. Racks of ancient 
      servers still running. A Sun SPARCstation quietly hosts something. 
      The hostname label reads "ELSEWHERE.MICROMUSE.ORG".
      
      Power usage meters show impossible values. Uptime displays "11,234 days". 
      A hand-drawn network diagram shows connections to places that don't 
      exist anymore: "GopherSpace", "The WELL", "FurryMUCK", "TinyTIM".
      
      In the corner, a terminal shows:
      ```
      WHO
      Players: 1427
      Wizards: 23
      Ghosts: âˆž
      You: Still here
      ```
      
      The cooling fans sound like whispered conversations from 1993.

    reality: |
      Behind the secret panel, a small room that shouldn't fit in the 
      apartment's footprint. The walls are covered in printouts of MUD 
      code - the original TinyMUD source, patches, hacks, evolutionary 
      branches that led nowhere and everywhere.
      
      In the center, on a pedestal made of stacked programming manuals, 
      sits a VT100 keyboard. Just the keyboard. The keys are worn smooth 
      except for 'Q', which was never used (who quits?).
      
      A plaque reads:
      "In memory of all the MU* that came before
       And all the wizards who never logged off
       Your worlds live on in unexpected places
       
       -- Anonymous Sysop, 2025
       
       P.S. If you understand why this matters, 
       you're already home."
      
      Touching the keyboard gives you a brief vision of a thousand 
      worlds built from nothing but text and imagination.

      You've found it. The actual backbone. Not corporate infrastructure, 
      not storm drains, but the place where all the old connections still 
      exist. Fiber optic cables pulse with conversations from 1993. Packets 
      that got lost decades ago finally finding their destinations.
      
      You can hear them all - the MUSEs, MUDs, MUCKs, MOOs. Every "look", 
      every "say", every lovingly crafted @desc echoing in the data streams. 
      A sign floats in digital space: "PACKET LOSS IS JUST MEMORIES TAKING 
      THE SCENIC ROUTE".
      
      Your terminal shows:
