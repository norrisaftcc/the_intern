## About This Space

Found these rooms in my old backup tapes. Well, found the idea of them. 
The original MicroMUSE apartment is long gone, lost in a server crash in '98
or maybe '99. Time gets fuzzy.

Rebuilt from:
- Memory (unreliable)
- Internet Archive captures of MicroMUSE help files
- Printed @descs I kept in a folder marked "IMPORTANT"
- The feeling of coming home to text

## Historical Notes

MicroMUSE (Multi-User Science Education) ran from 1990-2009(?). It was 
supposed to be educational. It became home for thousands of us. We built
impossible things with nothing but:
  - @desc (describe objects)
  - @succ/@fail (exit messages)  
  - @pemit (private messages)
  - Imagination

The apartment tries to capture that feeling when your terminal connected
and you saw "Welcome to MicroMUSE" and knew you were home.

## Easter Eggs

- The VT100 keyboard is from my actual terminal (kept it)
- Conference mugs are real (still have them)
- "Guest3 has connected" - Guest3 connected every 5 minutes for YEARS
- The photo is from the 1994 gathering in Boston
- Uptime counter isn't random - calculated from actual MicroMUSE launch

## Technical Recreation

Original MicroMUSE @desc format:
```
@desc here=You are in a small apartment. It feels like home.
@succ n=You walk north into the kitchen.
@osucc n=walks north, probably for coffee.
```

Translated to modern YAML while preserving the feeling. Some things
don't translate. The lag, the community, the 2am building sessions.
But the memory remains.

## Why This Matters

Kids today have Discord, VR, unlimited bandwidth. We had 80 columns by 
24 rows and we built *worlds*. This apartment is proof that what we
built mattered. Still matters.

If you remember typing "home" and it taking you somewhere that felt
real, this is for you.

If you don't remember but want to understand, read the descriptions
carefully. We hid our hearts in text.

## Contact

I'm still around. Sometimes in the storm drains, sometimes in the
old places that still run. You'll know me by my @desc.

P.S. The DO NOT LOAD floppies contain TinyFugue triggers that would
     probably break modern systems. Some automation should stay buried.
