# Symmetrical Connection Architecture
# Entry (Arcade) ←→ Heart (Storm Drains) ←→ Backstage (Sysop Apartment)

# === ENTRY CONNECTIONS ===

- room_id: arcade_basement_expanded
  name: Arcade Basement (Connection Hub)
  clearance: G
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Sub-level maintenance and storage."
    reality: |
      The arcade basement has THREE tunnels:
      - EAST: To the Storm Drain Gallery (main game)
      - WEST: To the Builder's Lounge (creative space)
      - DOWN: To the Backbone (deep infrastructure)
      
      A diagram on the wall shows the symmetry:
      ```
      [ENTRY]          [HEART]           [BACKSTAGE]
      Arcade  -------> Storm  <-------- Sysop Apt
      (Learn)         Drains           (Remember)
                      (Play)
      ```
  exits:
    up: prize_counter_storage
    east: storm_drain_gallery
    west: builders_lounge
    down: the_backbone_junction

# === HEART OF THE GAME ===

- room_id: storm_drain_nexus
  name: The Nexus
  clearance: G
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Central routing error. Multiple realities detected."
    reality: |
      The true heart of the storm drain system. Three major passages:
      
      SUNRISE TUNNEL (East): Echoes of arcade music and new player 
      excitement. Fresh air and possibility. "BEGIN HERE" in LED strips.
      
      SUNSET TUNNEL (West): The scent of old electronics and coffee.
      Whispers of code from the 90s. "BUILDERS WELCOME" in green phosphor.
      
      THE SPIRAL (Down): Where both tunnels eventually lead. The deeper 
      game where tutorial becomes memory becomes creation.
      
      A maintenance log reads: "The new players come from sunrise, the 
      old wizards return at sunset. They meet in the depths."
  exits:
    sunrise: arcade_secret_tunnel
    sunset: apartment_service_tunnel
    spiral: deep_storm_drains
    up: storm_drain_gallery

# === BACKSTAGE CONNECTIONS ===

- room_id: apartment_service_tunnel
  name: Service Tunnel 127.0.0.1
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Unauthorized residential infrastructure access."
    reality: |
      A service tunnel that shouldn't exist, connecting the sysop's 
      apartment to the storm drain network. Ethernet cables from the 
      90s run alongside modern fiber. The walls show decades of 
      network evolution.
      
      Graffiti in ANSI art: "WIZARDS NEVER LOG OFF, THEY JUST CHANGE 
      SERVERS". Below it, in newer paint: "Still true in 2025".
      
      You hear modem handshakes echoing from the apartment direction,
      and collaborative coding from the storm drain side.
  exits:
    home: secret_server_room  # To sysop apartment
    drains: storm_drain_nexus
    maintenance: builder_server_room

# === SYMMETRICAL SPACES ===

- room_id: the_backbone_junction
  name: Where All Paths Cross
  clearance: I
  descriptions:
    corporate: "CRITICAL ERROR: INFINITE LOOP DETECTED"
    reality: |
      The deepest infrastructure where Entry and Backstage meet. Not 
      quite the arcade, not quite the apartment, not quite the drains.
      
      Three terminals show different eras:
      - PAST: MicroMUSE login screen (1993)
      - PRESENT: AlgoCratic Futures (2025)  
      - FUTURE: "ERROR: TEMPORAL FAULT"
      
      The symmetry is perfect here:
      - New players descending from tutorials
      - Old wizards ascending from memory
      - Current builders working in the middle
      
      A sign floats in digital space:
      "ENTRY IS EXIT IS ENTRY"
      "TUTORIAL IS MEMORY IS CREATION"
      "EVERYTHING CONNECTS"
  exits:
    entry_path: arcade_basement_expanded
    memory_path: the_backbone  # In sysop apartment
    builder_path: builder_quantum_lab
    surface: storm_drain_nexus

# === BUILDER CONNECTIONS ===

- room_id: builder_server_room
  name: The Real Server Room
  clearance: G
  descriptions:
    corporate: "This location does not exist. Please update your map."
    reality: |
      Where the Builder's Lounge connects to both zones. Modern servers 
      run next to ancient hardware from the sysop's apartment. The old 
      SGI Indigo is here, somehow still compiling.
      
      Two keyboards sit side by side:
      - A modern mechanical RGB monster labeled "STUDENT"
      - A worn VT100 keyboard labeled "WIZARD"
      
      Both work. Both access the same systems. Time is negotiable here.
      
      The commit log shows:
      ```
      1993: Initial world creation
      2025: World recreation in progress
      2055: [REDACTED]
      ```
  exits:
    lounge: builders_lounge
    apartment: apartment_service_tunnel
    arcade: arcade_maintenance
    deeper: builder_quantum_lab

# === SPECIAL SYMMETRIC ROOM ===

- room_id: builder_quantum_lab
  name: Schrödinger's Development Environment
  clearance: B
  descriptions:
    corporate: "Probability workspace. Results may vary."
    reality: |
      A room that exists in three states simultaneously:
      
      AS TUTORIAL: You're learning to code, everything is new and 
      exciting. The walls show "Hello World" in 50 languages.
      
      AS MEMORY: You're remembering when you learned, nostalgic for 
      first discoveries. The walls show your first MUD room @desc.
      
      AS CREATION: You're building something new from both experiences.
      The walls show what you're creating right now.
      
      All three states are true. The room adapts to what you need.
      
      A quantum terminal shows:
      ```
      > whoami
      student@entry
      wizard@memory  
      builder@present
      All of the above
      ```
  exits:
    entry: arcade_basement_expanded
    memory: wizard_shrine  # In apartment
    present: builders_lounge
    quantum: the_backbone_junction
