      You made it north! A big "SUCCESS" sign lights up. A ticket

    reality: |
      A room that changes each time you look! Sometimes there are 
      three objects, sometimes five. Hidden items appear when you
      "look under table" or "look behind curtain". Each discovery
      earns a ticket. The trainer says: "Remember, you can look AT
      specific things for more detail!"

      3. GIVING PUZZLE: Give correct item to each NPC
      
      Each solved puzzle dispenses tickets. A leaderboard shows

      Old arcade cabinets have been repurposed as computer terminals
      for the underground MUD development. Ethernet cables snake
      through holes in the floor. A sign: "WELCOME TO THE REAL GAME".
