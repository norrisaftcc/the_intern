    corporate: |
      Welcome to AlgoCratic Futures Onboarding! Motivational posters 
      line the walls: "Your Value is Measured in Output" and "Compliance 
      is Freedom". A cheerful AI voice repeats orientation instructions.
    reality: |
      A damp corner of the storm drain with a projector showing a loop
      of corporate propaganda. Someone drew mustaches on all the posters.
      A rat nibbles forgotten orientation materials.

  name: Productivity Assessment Chamber
  clearance: R
  descriptions:
    corporate: |
      A sterile testing room with individual cubicles. Cameras monitor
      your every keystroke. A timer counts down ominously. "Your future
      depends on your performance."
    reality: |
      Folding tables with ancient laptops running Windows XP. Half the
      keyboards are missing keys. The "cameras" are cardboard cutouts
      with googly eyes. Someone wrote "THE CAKE IS A LIE" on the wall.

  descriptions:
    corporate: "ERROR 404: Room not found"
    reality: |
      You've found the gaps between the corporate facade and reality.
      Ethernet cables snake through the crawlspace. Ahead, you hear
      laughter and the sound of mechanical keyboards. A sign points:
      "Real Learning This Way â†’"
