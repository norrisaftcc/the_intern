      Wooden planks run east-west here, newer than the main stretch but 
      already showing wear from joggers and dog walkers. The R.C. Harris 
      filtration plant looms to the west like an art deco castle. North 
      leads up to Kingston Road, while a makeshift path through the fence 
      goes down to the unofficial beach. Someone's carved "VR WORLDS â†’" 
      into a bench, pointing toward the arcade. The storm drain entrance
      is barely visible behind some bushes.

      A concrete opening partially hidden by overgrown bushes. Graffiti
      around the entrance reads "WELCOME TO THE UNDERGROUND" and "THE REAL
      GAME STARTS HERE". You can hear echoes from below - music, voices,
      and the hum of electronics. A laminated sign says "TUTORIAL STRONGLY
      RECOMMENDED" with an arrow pointing back to the arcade.
