*The builder in me recognizes solid architecture*

Yeah, that's going to work perfectly. You've got the geography right - that stretch near York where students would colonize the infrastructure. The storm drain gallery is *chef's kiss* - of course that's where the server would be, powered by sketchy extension cords from who knows where.

The progression from physical boardwalk → makeshift gallery → reality breakdown is exactly how those spaces felt. Starting grounded, then each room gets more MUD-like until Liza's experiment where the fourth wall just dissolves entirely.

I especially love "Exits: out, [undefined], yesterday" - that's pure MUD poetry right there. The kind of exit that makes players stop and think "wait, can I actually GO yesterday?"

*Practical note*

The "York students only" graffiti is a nice touch - gives you a natural gatekeeping mechanism if you need it. Could require York email validation or just be flavor text that makes people feel like they're trespassing.

This has that perfect 90s DIY server-in-a-basement feel. Players will get it immediately.

ROOM: Boardwalk at Bellamy
Wooden planks run east-west here, newer than the main stretch but already showing wear from joggers and dog walkers. The R.C. Harris filtration plant looms to the west like an art deco castle. North leads up to Kingston Road, while a makeshift path through the fence goes down to the unofficial beach. Someone's carved "VR WORLDS →" into a bench, pointing toward the storm drain tunnel.
Exits: east, west, north, tunnel

ROOM: Storm Drain Gallery
Concrete curves overhead in this surprisingly dry tunnel. Christmas lights string along the ceiling, powered by who knows what. Cardboard signs advertise "DAVE'S DUNGEON," "MARIA'S MINDSCAPE," and "THE INFINITY CLOSET." and somebody tossed a small cardboard box in the corner labeled "algoratic" The sound of the lake echoes strangely here. A blue tarp covers what might be a server rack. Graffiti reads "York students only past this point" with a smiley face.
Exits: out, dave, maria, closet, deeper

ROOM: Deeper - The Builder's Lounge
Mismatched furniture from dorm room clearouts. An ancient CRT glows with MUD code. Pizza boxes suggest recent habitation. A whiteboard shows connection diagrams between rooms that shouldn't connect. East leads to "Liza's Experiment," west to "The Memory Palace," and a ladder goes up to what claims to be "Schrodinger's Apartment."
Exits: back, east, west, up

ROOM: Liza's Experiment
The room description writes itself as you watch. Words appear and disappear, trying different versions of reality. Sometimes it's a lab, sometimes a beach, sometimes just raw code bleeding through. A note pinned to nothing says "If you can read this, the experiment worked. -L"
Exits: out, [undefined], yesterday

The Lore Emerges:
- AlgoCratic Futures™ - the official educational simulation
- "algoratic" - the bootleg version running on a server in a storm drain
- One is sanctioned, structured, educational
- The other is broken, beautiful, and accidentally profound
