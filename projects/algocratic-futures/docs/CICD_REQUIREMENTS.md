# AlgoCratic Futures CI/CD Requirements

## Overview
CI/CD pipeline for a dystopian educational MUD running in Toronto storm drains.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Build & Test Pipeline
- **Python Backend**: FastAPI app testing
- **JavaScript Frontend**: Terminal interface validation
- **Agent System**: Personality loading tests
- **Clearance System**: ROYGBIV hierarchy integrity checks

### 2. Code Quality Gates
- **Linting**: Python (ruff/black) + JavaScript (eslint)
- **Type Checking**: mypy for Python, TypeScript checks
- **Security Scanning**: Check for exposed credentials
- **Coverage**: Minimum 70% for critical paths

### 3. Deployment Environments
- **Dev**: Storm drain test server (local)
- **Staging**: Builder's Lounge environment
- **Production**: Full storm drain network

### 4. Special Considerations
- **Agent Personality Files**: Validate JSON/hash documents
- **Room Descriptions**: Check for reality/corporate state consistency
- **PocketFlow Integration**: Mock tests until hardware ready
- **Kevin Protection**: Automated syntax validation to prevent nitpicking

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Pre-commit
```yaml
- Format code (black/prettier)
- Run local tests
- Check clearance system integrity
```

### Stage 2: Pull Request
```yaml
- Full test suite
- Build artifacts
- Deploy to review environment
- Generate surveillance report (test coverage)
```

### Stage 3: Main Branch
```yaml
- Deploy to staging
- Run integration tests
- Update agent personalities
- Deploy to production storm drains
```

## Success Metrics
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Zero clearance system violations
- 100% agent personality preservation
- Kevin comment reduction by 80%

## Infrastructure Needs
- GitHub Actions (free tier fine)
- Docker containers for consistency
- Secret management for storm drain access
- Monitoring for underground servers
