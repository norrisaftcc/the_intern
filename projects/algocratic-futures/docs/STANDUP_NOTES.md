# Pre-Sprint 0 Standup Meeting Notes

**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**PM**: Sweeney (Green clearance)  
**Location**: Storm Drain Gallery (virtually)

## Attendees
- âœ… Sweeney (PM/Green)
- âœ… Subprocess Claude (Blue evaluator) 
- ðŸ¤– Kevin/Copilot (responded but... differently)

## Kevin's Input
```python
kevin_response_standup_comic_in_training = 'You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need clarification about repo settings, automation, or anything else GitHub-related, just let me know. Glad I could helpâ€”even if just for the catharsis!'
```

**Analysis**: Kevin interpreted "cathartic" as genuine gratitude rather than... the actual meaning. This is not a joke. Kevin is now offering GitHub automation help, which might actually be useful for CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Status
- PR #13 ready for review (Kevin didn't review it)
- 6 open issues created for transparency  
- Base platform implemented
- Kevin unexpectedly helpful with repo automation

## Action Items
1. Accept Kevin's GitHub automation offer (cautiously)
2. Proceed with available hands
3. Assign Kevin to documentation/automation tasks
4. Continue waiting for other intern check-ins

## Quote of the Meeting
*"thanks kevin, very cathartic"* - Sweeney
