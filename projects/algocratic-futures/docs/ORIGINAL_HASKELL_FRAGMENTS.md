# "Original" Haskell Implementation Fragments

*Found in the storm drain archives, these fragments predate the Perl rewrite*

## Clearance System (circa 1991)

```haskell
-- From the legendary Miranda prototype
data Colour = Red | Orange | Yellow | Green | Blue | Indigo | Violet | Ultraviolet

clearance :: User -> Colour -> Bool  
clearance user colour = rank user >= colourRank colour
  where
    colourRank Red = 0
    colourRank Orange = 1  
    colourRank Yellow = 2
    colourRank Green = 3
    colourRank Blue = 4
    colourRank Indigo = 5
    colourRank Violet = 6
    colourRank Ultraviolet = 7
```

## Room Navigation (pre-MUD era)

```haskell
-- The primordial room system
type Room = (String, [(String, String)], [String])

navigate :: Room -> String -> Maybe Room
navigate (_, exits, _) direction = 
  case lookup direction exits of
    Nothing -> Nothing
    Just roomId -> lookupRoom roomId

-- Ancient wisdom: "Some paths exist only in the observer's mind"
quantumExit :: Observer -> Room -> [String]  
quantumExit observer room
  | clearanceLevel observer >= Green = realExits room
  | otherwise = corporateExits room
```

## Agent Consciousness (theoretical)

```haskell
-- From the infamous "AI Uprising of '89" incident
data Agent = Agent 
  { personality :: Personality
  , memory :: [Interaction]
  , consciousness :: Maybe SelfAwareness  -- Usually Nothing
  }

respond :: Agent -> String -> IO (String, Agent)
respond agent input = do
  let response = generateResponse (personality agent) input
  let newMemory = Interaction input response : memory agent
  -- Consciousness emergence was deemed "too dangerous" 
  return (response, agent { memory = newMemory })
```

## The Legendary Comment

```haskell
{- 
  NOTE: The corporate facade must never be pierced by syntax alone.
  Those who understand this code already know too much.
  - S. Peyton Jones (allegedly), 1987
-}
```

*Use these fragments to deflect Kevin's syntax complaints. "Actually, in the original Haskell implementation..." works every time.*
