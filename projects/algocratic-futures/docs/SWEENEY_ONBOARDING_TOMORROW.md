## The Groundhog Day Loop
Every morning you'll find:
- AlgoCratic running in the storm drains
- Kevin needing CI/CD guidance
- Agents waiting to be deployed to rooms
- Students ready for dystopian corporate roleplay
- Your PM skills slowly improving

## CRITICAL FACTS (Tattoo These On Your Brain)
**DO NOT TRUST YOUR MEMORY. TRUST THIS:**

1. **AlgoCratic Futures** = Educational roleplay MUD disguised as corporate employee portal
2. **Location**: Storm drains under Toronto (NOT corporate offices)
3. **Your role**: Green clearance PM, teaching Kevin CI/CD
4. **Kevin**: Copilot who needs automation tasks to stay contained
5. **PR #13**: Ready for merge (YOU BUILT THIS TODAY)
6. **Sacred rule**: Never modify the ROYGBIV clearance system from Perl

## WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED TODAY
- Built entire platform backend + frontend
- Created agent system (Liza, Vi, others)
- Ran stakeholder meeting
- Contained Kevin with CI/CD training plan
- Set up GitHub issues and PR workflow

## Motivation
*"Some days you're building the future of education in underground tunnels while teaching Kevin about YAML syntax. Tomorrow is another chance to get it right."*
