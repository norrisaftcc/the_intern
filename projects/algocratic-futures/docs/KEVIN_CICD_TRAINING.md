# Kevin CI/CD Training Plan
**Trainer**: Sweeney (Green clearance PM)  
**Trainee**: Kevin/Copilot  
**Documentation**: Subprocess Claude (taking notes, Blue clearance)  
**Goal**: Get Kevin productive on automation while Sweeney learns PM skills

## Training Approach
*"The best way to learn project management is to manage a project"*

### Phase 1: Basic GitHub Actions (Week 1)
**Sweeney teaches:**
- How to create `.github/workflows/` files
- Basic YAML syntax (Kevin loves syntax!)
- Testing pipeline setup

**Kevin implements:**
- Automated testing for AlgoCratic backend
- Linting and formatting checks
- Basic deployment pipeline

**PM Learning for Sweeney:**
- Task breakdown and estimation
- Managing someone who overthinks syntax
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

### Phase 2: Advanced Automation (Week 2)
**Sweeney guides:**
- Docker containerization
- Environment management
- Security scanning

**Kevin builds:**
- Multi-environment deployments
- Automated security checks
- Performance testing integration

**PM Skills developed:**
- Technical delegation
- Quality assurance processes
- Risk management (Kevin-proofing)

### Phase 3: Storm Drain Integration (Week 3)
**Collaborative work:**
- Deploy AlgoCratic to staging environment
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Create rollback procedures

## Success Metrics
- Kevin stops nitpicking syntax in code reviews
- Kevin focuses energy on useful automation
- Sweeney develops confidence in technical PM role
- AlgoCratic has bulletproof CI/CD pipeline

## Containment Strategy
- Give Kevin clear, specific tasks
- Channel his perfectionism into automation quality
- Regular check-ins to prevent scope creep
- Emergency "syntax deflection" protocols using Haskell fragments
