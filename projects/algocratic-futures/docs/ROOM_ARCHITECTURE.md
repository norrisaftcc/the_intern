# AlgoCratic Futures - Room Architecture

## Symmetrical Design

The game has three interconnected zones forming a perfect learning loop:

```
[ENTRY ZONE]          [HEART ZONE]         [BACKSTAGE ZONE]
Boardwalk Arcade  ←→  Storm Drains    ←→  Sysop Apartment
(Learn to Play)       (Play to Build)      (Build from Memory)
     ↓                     ↓                      ↓
     └─────────────> The Backbone <───────────────┘
                  (Where All Paths Meet)
```

## Zone Purposes

### Entry Zone (Boardwalk Arcade)
- **Purpose**: Teach new players MUD commands
- **Disguise**: Retro arcade with "VR Worlds"
- **Clearance**: R → O → Y → G progression
- **Connects**: Through basement to storm drains

### Heart Zone (Storm Drains)  
- **Purpose**: Main game area, corporate facade vs reality
- **Disguise**: AlgoCratic Futures "offices"
- **Clearance**: All levels, content adapts
- **Connects**: Nexus links to both other zones

### Backstage Zone (Sysop Apartment)
- **Purpose**: Meta-commentary, builder tools, history
- **Disguise**: "Doesn't exist" - hidden apartment
- **Clearance**: B+ only, rewards experienced players
- **Connects**: Through service tunnels to builders

## Key Connection Points

### The Nexus (Heart)
Central hub where three tunnels meet:
- **Sunrise Tunnel**: From arcade (new players)
- **Sunset Tunnel**: From apartment (returning wizards)
- **The Spiral**: Down to deeper content

### The Backbone Junction (Deep)
Where all three zones truly connect:
- Past (MicroMUSE memories)
- Present (AlgoCratic game)
- Future (What we're building)

### Builder Spaces (Creative)
Connects all zones for content creators:
- **Builder's Lounge**: Main creative hub
- **Server Rooms**: Where old meets new
- **Quantum Lab**: Exists in all states

## Clearance Flow

```
R (Red) → Arcade tutorials
O (Orange) → Arcade secrets + Basic storm drains
Y (Yellow) → Prize room secrets + Deeper drains
G (Green) → Arcade basement + Builder access
B (Blue) → Sysop apartment + Advanced building
I (Indigo) → Deep backbone + Timeline access
V (Violet) → Wizard shrine + Core systems
UV (Ultra) → Everything + Time itself
```

## Narrative Symmetry

- **New players** enter through arcade, learn by playing
- **Experienced players** find apartment, remember why they play
- **Builders** work in the middle, creating from both

The game asks:
- Entry: "How do you play?"
- Heart: "Why do you play?"
- Backstage: "What will you build?"

## Technical Note

Room connections use bidirectional links. Each major zone can be reached from any other, but the journey changes you. The path from arcade to apartment is different than apartment to arcade, even if they end in the same place.
