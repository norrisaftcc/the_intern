# Lab Activity: Teachable Machine Experiment

## Overview
In this lab, you will use Google's Teachable Machine to create a simple machine learning model without writing any code. This hands-on experiment will help you understand the basic workflow of machine learning, including data collection, training, and testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Experience the machine learning workflow firsthand
- Understand the importance of training data
- Learn about model accuracy and testing
- Experiment with a no-code ML tool

## Materials Needed
- Computer with internet access
- Webcam
- Browser (Chrome recommended)
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) website

## Instructions

### Part 1: Setup and Planning
1. Open the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) website
2. Click on "Get Started" and select "Image Project" 
3. Choose "Standard image model"
4. Plan your classification project - choose one of the following:
   - Facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised)
   - Hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors)
   - Objects at your desk (book, phone, coffee mug)
   - Custom idea (approved by instructor)

### Part 2: Data Collection
1. Create at least 3 classes by renaming Class 1, 2, and 3
2. For each class, collect at least 30 samples:
   - Click "Webcam" to enable your camera
   - Hold the "Record" button while showing examples of each class
   - Try to capture different angles, lighting, and variations
3. Review your samples and remove any poor quality images

### Part 3: Training
1. Click the "Train Model" button
2. Observe the training process - notice how the model's accuracy improves over time
3. Wait for training to complete

### Part 4: Testing
1. Use the "Preview" panel to test your model in real-time
2. Try different examples of each class and note the confidence scores
3. Identify cases where the model performs well and where it struggles
4. Take screenshots of interesting results

### Part 5: Refinement
1. Add more training examples for classes that have lower accuracy
2. Retrain your model
3. Test again to see if performance improved
4. Iterate this process 2-3 times

## Deliverables
Prepare a lab report document that includes:

1. **Introduction**: Describe your classification project and why you chose it
2. **Data Collection**: Explain how you collected training data and any challenges
3. **Model Performance**: 
   - Include screenshots showing your model in action
   - Discuss the accuracy for each class
   - Analyze when and why your model succeeded or failed
4. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - Describe how you refined your model
   - Compare performance before and after refinement
5. **Reflection**:
   - Relate this experience to the ML workflow discussed in class
   - Identify limitations of this approach
   - Suggest improvements or extensions

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your lab report as a PDF document
- Include at least 3 screenshots demonstrating your model's performance
- Maximum 3 pages (not including screenshots)
- Due date: [Insert date]

## Extension Activities (Optional)
- Export your model and create a simple web page that uses it
- Create a more complex model with 5+ classes
- Compare performance between image, audio, and pose projects
- Research the neural network architecture used by Teachable Machine
