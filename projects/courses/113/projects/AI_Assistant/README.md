# AI Assistant Project

## Overview
In this final project, you will design and implement a simple AI assistant that demonstrates your understanding of key AI concepts learned throughout the course. The assistant will integrate various AI capabilities, including natural language processing, response generation, and ethical considerations.

## Objectives
- Apply AI fundamentals learned in the course to a practical application
- Integrate multiple AI services and tools
- Demonstrate understanding of prompt engineering
- Address ethical considerations in AI assistant design

## Requirements

### Core Features
Your AI assistant should include the following features:
1. Text-based interface for user interaction
2. Natural language processing to understand user queries
3. Response generation using a language model
4. At least one specialized capability (e.g., summarization, creative writing, data analysis)
5. Basic context retention between interactions
6. Implementation of responsible AI principles

### Technical Requirements
- Use at least one AI API or service (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- Implement proper error handling and edge cases
- Include documentation for setup and usage
- Provide examples of effective prompts
- Create a simple but functional user interface

### Documentation
Your project must include:
1. Project report (3-5 pages) covering:
   - Design decisions and architecture
   - AI models and services used
   - Prompt engineering strategies
   - Ethical considerations addressed
   - Limitations and future improvements
2. Code documentation with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Function/method descriptions
   - API references

## Milestones
1. **Project Proposal** (Week 8)
   - Project concept and features
   - Technologies and APIs to be used
   - Initial design sketch

2. **Progress Check** (Week 10)
   - Basic functionality implemented
   - Integration with AI services
   - Initial user interface

3. **Final Submission** (Week 12)
   - Complete working application
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Presentation materials

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality (40%): Does the assistant work as intended?
- Integration (20%): How well are AI concepts integrated?
- Design (15%): Is the application well-structured?
- Documentation (15%): Is the project well-documented?
- Creativity (10%): Does the project show innovative approaches?

## Resources
- API documentation for chosen services
- Example code from modules 7 and 8
- Prompt engineering guidelines from module 8
- Ethics framework from module 9
