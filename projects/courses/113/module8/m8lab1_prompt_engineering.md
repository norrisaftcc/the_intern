# Lab Activity: Prompt Engineering Challenge

## Overview
In this lab, you will explore the art and science of prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs). You will experiment with different prompting techniques to achieve specific outcomes and learn how small changes in prompts can significantly impact results.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of effective prompt design
- Experiment with different prompting techniques
- Compare results across different prompts
- Develop skills in iterative refinement
- Identify limitations and biases in LLM responses

## Materials Needed
- Computer with internet access
- Access to ChatGPT, Claude, or another LLM (instructor will provide)
- Spreadsheet or document for recording results

## Instructions

### Part 1: Basic Prompting Techniques
Try each of the following prompting techniques with the same basic task: getting information about renewable energy.

1. **Zero-shot prompting**:
   - Prompt: "Tell me about solar energy technology."
   - Record the response.

2. **Few-shot prompting**:
   - Prompt: "Here are some facts about wind energy:
     - Wind energy is generated by turbines
     - Modern turbines can be over 150m tall
     - Wind is a renewable resource
     
     Now, tell me about solar energy technology."
   - Record the response and note differences from the first approach.

3. **Role-based prompting**:
   - Prompt: "You are a renewable energy expert with 20 years of experience in the solar industry. Tell me about solar energy technology."
   - Record the response and note differences in tone, detail, and authority.

4. **Format specification**:
   - Prompt: "Tell me about solar energy technology. Format your response as a bulleted list of key facts, followed by three pros and three cons."
   - Record how well the LLM follows the formatting instructions.

### Part 2: Advanced Prompting Challenges
Complete the following challenges to test your prompt engineering skills:

1. **Overcoming vagueness**:
   - Start with the vague prompt: "Help me with my homework."
   - Through a series of iterations, refine this prompt to get useful information about statistical analysis methods for a psychology research project.
   - Document each prompt version and the corresponding response.

2. **Managing verbosity**:
   - Start with: "Explain quantum computing."
   - Create three different prompts that get explanations at three different levels:
     - A short 2-3 sentence explanation
     - A medium-length paragraph
     - A comprehensive explanation
   - Record all prompts and responses.

3. **Controlling perspective**:
   - Choose a somewhat controversial topic (e.g., nuclear energy, genetic modification)
   - Craft prompts that encourage the LLM to present:
     - A balanced view
     - A primarily positive view
     - A primarily critical view
   - Compare the responses and reflect on ethical considerations.

4. **Iterative refinement**:
   - Start with a basic creative prompt like "Write a short story about climate change."
   - Through at least 3 iterations, refine the story by giving feedback and specific requests.
   - Document the evolution of the story through your prompting.

### Part 3: Prompt Engineering Puzzles
Solve these specific prompt engineering puzzles:

1. **Consistency challenge**: Craft a prompt that gets the LLM to provide exactly five examples of something, no more and no less. Try with different topics.

2. **Data extraction challenge**: Find a paragraph of text about AI history and create a prompt that extracts just the names of researchers and their contributions in a table format.

3. **Creativity challenge**: Design a prompt that generates a truly unique metaphor for how the internet works.

4. **Bias detection**: Craft a series of prompts on the same topic but worded differently to try to detect subtle biases in the LLM's responses.

## Deliverables
Create a "Prompt Engineering Portfolio" that includes:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of prompt engineering and its importance

2. **Basic Techniques**: 
   - All prompts and responses from Part 1
   - Analysis of differences between approaches

3. **Advanced Challenges**:
   - Documentation of all prompts and key insights from Part 2
   - Reflection on which techniques were most effective and why

4. **Puzzle Solutions**:
   - Your solutions to the prompt engineering puzzles
   - Explanation of your approach

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Personal best practices for prompt engineering
   - Observations about LLM limitations
   - Ethical considerations
