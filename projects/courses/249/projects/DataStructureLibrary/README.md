# Data Structure Library Project

## Overview
In this comprehensive project, you will design and implement a library of data structures in C++. This project will demonstrate your understanding of fundamental data structures, algorithm analysis, and object-oriented programming principles. Your library should provide efficient and well-documented implementations that could be used in real-world applications.

## Objectives
- Create a cohesive library of data structures with a consistent interface
- Implement multiple data structures with proper encapsulation
- Apply algorithm analysis principles to optimize implementations
- Develop comprehensive testing and documentation

## Requirements

### Core Components
Your data structure library must include implementations of:

1. **Linear Data Structures**
   - Dynamic Array (vector-like)
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Stack (with both array and linked list implementations)
   - Queue (with both array and linked list implementations)

2. **Tree Structures**
   - Binary Search Tree
   - AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree (self-balancing)
   - Heap/Priority Queue

3. **Hash-Based Structures**
   - Hash Table (with at least one collision resolution strategy)
   - Hash Map (key-value store)

### Technical Requirements
- Use C++ templates for type-agnostic implementations
- Follow consistent naming conventions across all structures
- Implement proper memory management
- Include appropriate exception handling
- Ensure all structures have O(1), O(log n), or O(n) operations as appropriate
- Document the Big O complexity of all operations
- Create a coherent interface pattern across different structures

### Testing Requirements
- Comprehensive test cases for each data structure
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Edge case testing
- Comparison tests between different implementations

### Documentation
Your project must include:
1. Class documentation with:
   - Purpose and usage
   - Template parameters
   - Method descriptions with complexity analysis
   - Implementation notes
   
2. User guide covering:
   - Installation instructions
   - Basic usage examples
   - Selection guide for choosing appropriate structures
   
3. Performance analysis report:
   - Benchmark results
   - Comparison with STL implementations
   - Recommendations for different use cases

## Milestones
1. **Design Phase** (Week 3)
   - API design and interface documentation
   - Class hierarchy planning
   - Test plan development

2. **Linear Structures** (Week 6)
   - Implementation of all linear data structures
   - Unit tests for basic operations
   - Initial documentation

3. **Tree and Hash Structures** (Week 9)
   - Implementation of tree and hash-based structures
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Final Library** (Week 12)
   - Complete code base with all structures
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Performance analysis report
   - Example applications

## Evaluation Criteria
- Implementation Correctness (30%): Do all structures work as expected?
- Interface Design (20%): Is the API consistent and intuitive?
- Performance (20%): Are the implementations efficient?
- Testing (15%): Is there comprehensive test coverage?
- Documentation (15%): Is the library well-documented?

## Application Demonstration
As part of the final submission, you should include at least one small application that demonstrates the practical use of your library, such as:
- A simple text indexing system using your hash table
- A job scheduler using your priority queue
- A graph traversal algorithm using your implementations
- A comparative benchmark suite

## Getting Started
1. Review the data structure implementations from class
2. Study the STL container interfaces for inspiration
3. Design your template interfaces before implementing
4. Create a testing framework early in the process
