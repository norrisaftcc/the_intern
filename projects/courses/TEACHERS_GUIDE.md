## General Teaching Philosophy

### Active Learning
Focus on active learning where students engage with concepts through coding, discussion, and problem-solving rather than passive lectures. Each module contains hands-on activities that should form the core of classroom time.

### Scaffolded Approach
Course materials are designed with a scaffolded approach, building complexity gradually. Early modules contain more detailed guidance, while later modules encourage greater independence.

### Real-World Relevance
Connect theoretical concepts to practical applications and current industry practices. Use examples from real-world software and systems to illustrate concepts.

### Collaboration and Communication
Encourage pair programming, code reviews, and team projects to develop both technical and communication skills. Create opportunities for students to explain their code and design decisions.

## Course-Specific Guidelines

### CSC113 - AI Fundamentals

#### Teaching Approach
This course introduces students with varying technical backgrounds to AI concepts. Focus on building intuition and practical experience with tools rather than mathematical foundations.

#### Key Challenges
- **Varying technical backgrounds**: Provide additional resources for those needing more support
- **Rapidly evolving field**: Update examples and tools to reflect current state of AI
- **Ethical dimensions**: Integrate ethical discussions throughout, not just in the dedicated module

#### Recommended Tools
- Teachable Machine for no-code ML experience
- Hugging Face for exploring models
- OpenAI or Claude for prompt engineering exercises
- Google Colab for any Python notebooks

#### Assessment Focus
Evaluate understanding of core concepts and ability to use AI tools effectively rather than the ability to implement algorithms from scratch.

### CSC134 - Introduction to C++

#### Teaching Approach
This course establishes programming fundamentals using C++. Focus on building strong foundations in syntax, problem-solving, and program organization.

#### Key Challenges
- **First programming language**: Many students will be learning to program for the first time
- **C++ complexity**: Shield beginners from advanced language features initially
- **Debugging struggles**: Teach systematic debugging approaches early

#### Recommended Tools
- Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks as IDE
- Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) for assembly visualization
- C++ Reference websites
- Debugging visualization tools

#### Assessment Focus
Evaluate code functionality, proper syntax usage, problem-solving approach, and increasing code organization/style as the course progresses.

### CSC249 - Data Structures

#### Teaching Approach
This course builds on programming fundamentals to explore data structures and algorithms. Focus on both implementation and analysis of when to use different structures.

#### Key Challenges
- **Abstract concepts**: Making data structures tangible through visualization
- **Analysis understanding**: Helping students grasp Big O notation
- **Implementation details**: Balancing theoretical understanding with correct implementation

#### Recommended Tools
- Data structure visualizers
- Algorithm animation tools
- Benchmarking frameworks for performance testing
- GitHub for version control of larger projects

#### Assessment Focus
Evaluate implementation correctness, understanding of time/space complexity, appropriate data structure selection, and code organization.

### CTS285/CSC289 - Application Development

#### Teaching Approach
This two-semester sequence focuses on the complete software development lifecycle. Emphasize professional practices, teamwork, and delivering production-quality software.

#### Key Challenges
- **Team dynamics**: Helping students work effectively in teams
- **Project scope**: Guiding appropriate scoping of projects
- **Technical integration**: Supporting integration of multiple technologies
- **Professional practices**: Instilling good habits around testing, documentation, etc.

#### Recommended Tools
- Project management tools (Jira, Trello)
- Git and GitHub for collaboration
- Continuous integration services
- Deployment platforms (depending on project type)

#### Assessment Focus
Evaluate both technical implementation and professional skills including teamwork, communication, documentation, and project management.

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment
- **Code reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to provide feedback
- **Check-ins**: Brief demonstrations of current progress
- **Quizzes**: Short conceptual quizzes to gauge understanding
- **Peer feedback**: Structured peer review sessions

### Summative Assessment
- **Projects**: Major projects that demonstrate comprehensive understanding
- **Exams**: Balanced between conceptual understanding and practical application
- **Presentations**: Student explanations of their work and design decisions
- **Portfolios**: Collection of work demonstrating growth throughout the course

### Rubrics
Detailed rubrics for major assignments are provided in module folders. These rubrics emphasize both technical correctness and development process.

## Project-Based Learning

### Project Selection
- **Scaffolded projects**: Early projects include more guidance
- **Open-ended projects**: Later projects allow more student creativity
- **Authentic tasks**: Projects mimic real-world development scenarios

### Project Management
- **Milestones**: Break larger projects into manageable checkpoints
- **Documentation**: Require planning and documentation as deliverables
- **Reflection**: Include reflection on process and lessons learned

## Supporting Diverse Learners

### Multiple Learning Pathways
- **Visual learners**: Provide diagrams and visualizations
- **Hands-on learners**: Emphasize code examples and exercises
- **Conceptual learners**: Include theoretical explanations

### Scaffolding
- **Templates**: Provide code templates for complex projects
- **Pseudocode**: Use pseudocode before implementation
- **Starter code**: Offer partial implementations for complex topics

### Acceleration
- **Challenge problems**: Include additional challenges for advanced students
- **Extension activities**: Suggest ways to extend basic assignments
- **Mentoring opportunities**: Encourage advanced students to support peers
