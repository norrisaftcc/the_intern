# Teaching Guide: Team Charter Exercise

## Overview
The team charter exercise helps students establish shared values, expectations, and working agreements that will guide their collaboration throughout the two-semester project. This guide provides instructors with approaches to facilitate this essential team-building activity.

## Learning Objectives
- Foster team cohesion and identity formation
- Establish clear communication protocols and expectations
- Encourage thoughtful consideration of values and ethics in software development
- Create a reference document teams can use to resolve conflicts

## Suggested Values for Discussion
Present these example values to students, but encourage them to discuss and select those that resonate with their team or create their own:

### Technical Values
- **Code Quality**: "We commit to writing clean, maintainable, and well-tested code."
- **Continuous Learning**: "We embrace new technologies and techniques that improve our product."
- **Open Source Philosophy**: "We value the open source community and will contribute back when possible."
- **Documentation**: "We believe well-documented code and processes are essential for sustainability."

### Process Values
- **Transparency**: "We maintain open and honest communication about progress and challenges."
- **Accountability**: "We take ownership of our work and commitments to the team."
- **Iterative Development**: "We believe in small, frequent improvements over perfect solutions."
- **Work-Life Balance**: "We respect each other's time and wellbeing beyond the project."

### Product Values
- **User-Centric Design**: "We prioritize the needs and experiences of our users."
- **Accessibility**: "We design our product to be usable by people of all abilities."
- **Data Privacy**: "We protect our users' data and respect their privacy choices."
- **Sustainability**: "We consider the environmental impact of our technology choices."

### Community Values
- **Inclusivity**: "We value diverse perspectives and ensure everyone's voice is heard."
- **Respectful Communication**: "We communicate constructively, even during disagreements."
- **Collaboration**: "We achieve more by working together than individually."
- **Recognition**: "We celebrate each other's contributions and successes."

## Licensing Discussion Points
When discussing project licensing, consider introducing students to:

- **MIT License**: Simple and permissive; allows commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use with minimal restrictions. Consider subtly recommending this for student projects due to its simplicity and widespread use.

- **GNU GPL**: Requires derivative works to also be open source; ensures software remains free.

- **Apache License**: Similar to MIT but includes patent protection provisions.

- **Proprietary**: Closed source approach typical in some commercial settings.

Discuss how license choice reflects team values around openness, commercialization, and community contribution.

## Facilitation Approach

### Step 1: Introduction (15 minutes)
- Explain the purpose and importance of a team charter
- Share examples of effective charters from previous classes or industry
- Review the template structure

### Step 2: Values Brainstorming (30 minutes)
- Have teams brainstorm values that matter to them
- Present the suggested values list for inspiration
- Encourage teams to prioritize 5-7 core values

### Step 3: Agreement Development (45 minutes)
- For each value, teams should develop concrete agreements
- Example: For "Accountability," an agreement might be "Team members will notify the group at least 24 hours in advance if they cannot meet a deadline."
- Discuss how these agreements will be enforced

### Step 4: Decision-Making and Conflict Resolution (30 minutes)
- Guide teams to establish how decisions will be made (consensus, majority vote, etc.)
- Develop a step-by-step process for resolving conflicts
- Identify when and how to escalate issues to the instructor

### Step 5: Charter Finalization (30 minutes)
- Teams compile their values, agreements, and processes into a cohesive document
- All team members sign the charter
- Determine how and when the charter will be revisited/revised

## Assessment Criteria
Provide these criteria to students for creating their team charter:

- **Comprehensiveness**: Addresses all key aspects of team collaboration
- **Specificity**: Includes concrete agreements, not just vague statements
- **Practicality**: Creates realistic expectations that teams can follow
- **Consensus**: Reflects input and agreement from all team members
- **Professionalism**: Presented as a polished, well-organized document

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Dominant personalities overshadowing others
**Solution**: Use round-robin techniques where each student must contribute at least one value or agreement.

### Challenge: Creating overly idealistic agreements
**Solution**: Ask students to consider past team experiences and anticipate realistic challenges.

### Challenge: Treating the charter as a formality
**Solution**: Reference the charter in subsequent classes and project check-ins to reinforce its importance.

## Follow-up Activities
- Schedule a charter review after the first sprint to refine based on early experiences
- Have teams periodically assess how well they're adhering to their charter
- Use the charter as a reference point during conflict resolution discussions
