# CTS285/CSC289: Project Concept Guide

## Course Project Approach

In this two-semester application development sequence, students will work in teams of 3-4 to develop a complete software application from concept to deployment. Rather than starting from scratch, teams will select from pre-prepared project concepts that provide a structured foundation while allowing for creativity and innovation in implementation.

## Teaching Philosophy

This guided approach offers several pedagogical advantages:

1. **Balanced Scaffolding**: Provides enough structure to prevent analysis paralysis while allowing substantial creative freedom
2. **Industry Relevance**: Mirrors how many real-world development teams operate (implementing specified concepts rather than creating entirely new ones)
3. **Equitable Starting Point**: Ensures all teams begin with viable concepts regardless of prior experience
4. **Focused Learning**: Directs energy toward development skills rather than concept generation
5. **Comparable Evaluation**: Facilitates more consistent assessment across different teams
