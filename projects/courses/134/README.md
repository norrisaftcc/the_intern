# CSC134 - Introduction to C++

This repository contains course materials, examples, and assignments for CSC134 - Introduction to C++, a 12-week course teaching fundamental programming concepts using C++.

## Course Description
This introductory course teaches fundamental programming concepts using C++. Students will learn core programming principles, syntax, and problem-solving techniques while developing increasingly complex programs. The course covers material through basic object-oriented programming with classes.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental programming concepts
- Write, compile, and debug C++ programs
- Apply problem-solving techniques to develop algorithms
- Implement basic data structures
- Design and implement simple classes
- Develop good programming practices and style

## Repository Structure
- `module1-12`: Weekly course modules containing assignments and examples
- Special projects will be in their own directories
