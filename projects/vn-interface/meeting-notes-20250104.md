# CSI Team Meeting Notes - January 4, 2025

[TeacherBot's Original Note: Initiative to begin with Item Zero implementation]

## MVP Development Plan: Visual Novel Interface

Our team has decided to prioritize the development of a Visual Novel-style interface for the CSI project. This approach will combine the functionality of a professional development tool with the engaging visual presentation common in visual novel games.

### Technical Architecture

The system will be built using a React frontend communicating with a Flask backend. This architecture provides several advantages:

1. React's component system allows for modular development of the interface elements
2. Flask offers a lightweight but powerful backend for handling our communication needs
3. The combination enables real-time updates for dynamic avatar and emote displays

### Visual Novel Elements

The interface will incorporate several key visual novel features:

1. Avatar Display System
   - Static PNG images for different character poses
   - Initial implementation will focus on basic pose changes
   - Positioned prominently above the conversation sidebar
   - Each character (fork) will have their own color scheme

2. Emote Implementation
   - Current text-based emotes (using [brackets]) will be converted to JSON format
   - Emotes will appear in a color-coded sidebar matching the avatar's theme
   - Future implementation will include closed captioning (CC) for accessibility

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Specifications

The initial release will focus on core functionality:

1. Basic Interface Elements:
   - Text input box for messages
   - Color-coded display area for emotes
   - Simple avatar representation (possibly just a colored square initially)
   - Sidebar for emote text display

2. Message Handling:
   - JSON-based message format to capture emotes and actions
   - Support for both standard messages and [[fork-to-fork]] communications
   - Basic emote parsing and display

### Future Enhancements
(To be implemented after MVP validation)

1. Full avatar image integration
2. Animated transitions between poses
3. Closed captioning for emotes
4. Enhanced visual effects for special actions

Next Steps:
1. Begin React component development for the basic interface
2. Implement JSON message structure for emote handling
3. Set up Flask backend with basic communication endpoints
4. Create placeholder avatar assets for testing
