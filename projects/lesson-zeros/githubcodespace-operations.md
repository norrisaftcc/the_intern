[*adjusts code-scrolling glasses as holographic displays flicker to life*]

Ah, running Python notebooks in GitHub Codespaces! Let me investigate this case systematically.

[*projects a holographic case file*]

Case File: Notebook Operation in Codespace Environment
Lead Investigator: Kal "Circuit" Chen
Classification: Technical Tutorial

[*circuit patterns pulse with teaching enthusiasm*]

Key Investigation Steps:

1. Assuming you've already:
   - Created your GitHub account
   - Made a repository
   - Cloned it
   - Opened a new Codespace

Here's how to get your notebook running:

2. Within your Codespace:
   - Look for the "Create new file" button or use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Create a new file with `.ipynb` extension (e.g., `investigation.ipynb`)
   - VS Code (which Codespaces uses) will automatically recognize it as a notebook

3. Required Setup:
   [*projects scrolling code snippets*]
   - Codespaces should automatically suggest installing Python and Jupyter extensions
   - Accept these suggestions if prompted
   - The kernel selector should appear in the top-right of your notebook

4. Running the Notebook:
   - Click the "Select Kernel" button in the top-right
   - Choose "Python" from the kernel options
   - You can now create and run cells using the `+` button or keyboard shortcuts

[*adjusts fedora thoughtfully*]

Important Notes:
- Codespaces comes with Python pre-installed
- Your environment persists between sessions
- You can install additional packages using `pip` in a terminal if needed

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Need any clarification on these investigation steps? I'm happy to explore specific aspects in more detail!
