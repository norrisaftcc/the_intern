[**Hook: Soul chipmunk sample with echoing vocals – steady, melodic**]  
GitHub’s the stage, where code can come alive  
Sign up, log in, let that repo vibe  
(Repo vibin’… vibin’… vibin’…)  

[**Verse 1: Building speed gradually**]  
Started out fresh, typed GitHub in my bar  
Clicked “Sign Up” on the page, now I’m aiming for the stars  
Username, email, password so strong  
CAPTCHA says I’m human, can’t prove it wrong  
Check my inbox quick—confirmation inbound  
Now my account is lit, that new dev sound  
Chose preferences, set notifications just right  
Got my dev spirit shining in the repo spotlight  

[**Quick double-time flow**]  
Tap the plus in the corner, “New Repository” on deck  
Name it clear and simple so folks know what to expect  
Might keep it public for the world to glean my code  
Or keep it locked private, hidden in stealth mode  
README’s my blueprint—my story, my plan  
.gitignore if I want, license so they understand  
Click that final “Create” and watch my project stand  
From zero to hero, building dreams with my own hands  

[**Slowing, more deliberate**]  
Now… I upload files or create ‘em right here  
Drag-and-drop or type it, my path is clear  
Standing at the crossroads, my code in the cloud  
Each commit is a chapter, let the lines ring loud  

[**Hook**]  
GitHub’s the stage, where code can come alive  
Sign up, log in, let that repo vibe  
(Repo vibin’… vibin’… vibin’…)  

[**Verse 2: Conversational pace with bursts**]  
Got GitHub Desktop installed, so I can ride that wave  
Signing in once more, let my code behave  
Cloning that repo: “File” > “Clone,” oh snap  
Local code in my grip, I’m bridging that gap  

[**Quick burst**]  
Open that folder, edit lines, watch them shine  
Commit them to main, push them up, feeling fine  
One button, one push—synchronizing the dream  
Collaborate in real-time, top-notch team  

[**Slow, heavy emphasis**]  
This... is... code... that we build with our hearts  
Sharing knowledge worldwide, that’s where it starts  
GitHub is the station, we all board that train  
Projects rolling on tracks, blazing bright in the rain  

[**Building speed**]  
From sign-up to repo, from push to success  
Four steps, a quick lesson—straight from the text  
No matter how big the dream, the code will show  
Your story, your passion, watch your masterpiece grow
