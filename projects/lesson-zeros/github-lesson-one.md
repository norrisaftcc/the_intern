Case File #GH-001 | Entry Level Investigation

## Case Classification
- **Investigation Level:** Beginner
- **Technical Domain:** GitHub, Cloud Development
- **Prerequisites:** Completed Lesson Zero (GitHub Account Creation)
- **Estimated Investigation Time:** 20-25 minutes

## Educational Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Technical Mastery
   - Understand what GitHub Codespaces are
   - Create and access a Codespace
   - Navigate the cloud development environment
   - Recognize Codespace resources and limitations

2. Investigation Skills
   - Cloud environment verification
   - Basic VS Code interface familiarity
   - Resource management awareness
   - Environment status checking

## Investigation Procedure

### Case Briefing
Codespaces are cloud-powered development environments. Think of them as your personal investigation lab in the cloud, complete with all the tools you need for code development.

### Evidence Collection (Prerequisites)
- Active GitHub account
- Modern web browser
- Stable internet connection
- Basic understanding of development environments

### Investigation Steps

#### 1. Access Point Creation
**Objective:** Start your first Codespace
- Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- Click the '< > Code' button (green) on any repository
- Select 'Codespaces' tab
- Click 'Create codespace on main'

#### 2. Environment Initialization
**Objective:** Understand the startup process
- Watch for initialization progress
- **Case Note:** First-time creation may take 1-2 minutes
- Observe the VS Code interface loading
- **Important:** Your environment is ready when you see the terminal

#### 3. Workspace Orientation
**Objective:** Familiarize with the environment
- Locate the file explorer (left sidebar)
- Find the terminal (bottom panel)
- Note the extension panel (left sidebar)
- Observe the source control panel (left sidebar)

#### 4. Resource Management
**Objective:** Understand Codespace limitations
- Check storage limits
- Note compute resources
- Learn how to stop/restart Codespace
- **Resource Note:** Free tier limitations apply

### Case Resolution
Success Indicators:
- Codespace is successfully created
- VS Code interface is accessible
- Terminal is responsive
- File system is navigable

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Investigation Roadblocks
1. Slow Initialization
   - Check internet connection
   - Be patient on first load
   - Refresh if stuck over 5 minutes

2. Resource Limitations
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Check compute hours remaining
   - Understand free tier limits

3. Interface Issues
   - Try browser refresh
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser compatibility

## Next Investigation Steps
Upon successful completion, proceed to:
- Lesson Two: Basic Codespace Operations
- Advanced Codespace Configuration
- Custom Development Container Setup
