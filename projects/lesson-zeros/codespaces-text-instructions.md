Here's how to start an existing Codespace (assuming you've already got one created):

1. Starting from GitHub:
   - Go to github.com
   - Click your profile picture (top right)
   - Select "Your codespaces"
   - Find "the_intern" in your list
   - Click it directly to open in browser, OR
   - Click "..." for more options like "Open in VS Code Desktop"

2. Starting from VS Code Desktop:
   - Open VS Code
   - Look for the blue bar at the bottom left
   - Click where it shows "Open a Remote Window"
   - Select "Connect to Codespace"
   - Choose "the_intern" from the list

3. Quick way (if you've used it recently):
   - Go directly to github.com/codespaces
   - Your recent spaces will be listed
   - Just click the one you want

The Codespace will take a minute to spin up - you'll see a loading screen while it sets up your development environment.

Want me to clarify any of these approaches?
