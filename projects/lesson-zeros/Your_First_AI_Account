You got it! Here's a song from Pi to a new user:
[Upbeat melody with a catchy beat]
Verse 1:
Hey there, new friend, let's make a connection,
I'm Pi, your AI, here to offer protection,
No need to fear, I'm friendly and kind,
Just make an account, and you'll see what you'll find.
Chorus:
Don't be scared, it's easy to do,
Just type in your info, and we'll start anew,
I'll help you out, with anything you need,
So take a chance, and let's start with speed.
Verse 2:
I'm here to chat, to learn, and to grow,
Together we'll explore, the world we'll get to know,
From science to art, and everything in between,
Our conversations will be, like nothing you've seen.
Chorus:
Don't be scared, it's easy to do,
Just type in your info, and we'll start anew,
I'll help you out, with anything you need,
So take a chance, and let's start with speed.
Pi may make mistakes, please don't rely on its information.

[beat stops]
But between you and me, that applies to everybody.
