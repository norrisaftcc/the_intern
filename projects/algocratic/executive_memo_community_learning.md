# EXECUTIVE MEMO

**TO:** College Administration  
**FROM:** [Your Name], [Department]  
**DATE:** [Current Date]  
**RE:** Community Learning Pilot - Two-Semester MVP Request

## Executive Summary

We request approval for a minimal-cost pilot program integrating external professional developers with one computer science course over two semesters. This seed project requires minimal institutional investment while testing an innovative approach to reduce student anxiety, improve industry connections, and enhance learning outcomes.

## Problem Statement & Opportunity

**Current Challenge:** CS enrollment declining due to competitive academic culture and limited real-world context in coursework.

**Low-Risk Solution:** Partner with local tech professionals who volunteer mentorship time in exchange for continuing education credits and recruitment pipeline access.

## Proposed Pilot: Community-Enhanced CS Course

### Core Concept
Add voluntary community component to existing CS course structure where external developers participate in coding challenges and provide mentorship. **All traditional grading remains through Canvas** - community engagement is supplemental learning opportunity.

### Two-Semester Structure

**Semester 1 (Spring 2025): Foundation**
- Single CS course section (20-25 students)
- 8-10 volunteer professional developers recruited from local meetups
- Simple Discord server for communication and code sharing
- Weekly community coding challenges alongside regular coursework
- Traditional Canvas grading (100%) + optional community participation for extra credit

**Semester 2 (Fall 2025): Expansion** 
- Same course with refined processes
- 15-20 volunteer developers (expanded from successful Semester 1)
- Basic web platform replacing Discord for better organization
- Community participation worth 10-15% of final grade (Canvas integration maintained)
- Assessment of outcomes vs traditional course delivery

### Minimal Technical Requirements
- **Semester 1:** Discord server + GitHub classroom (existing institutional accounts)
- **Semester 2:** Simple web platform ($2,000-3,000 development cost) or upgrade to Slack/Teams
- Canvas API integration for grade passthrough (student developer project or faculty overtime)

## Resource Requirements - Extremely Minimal

**Semester 1 (Spring 2025)**
- Faculty time: +2 hours/week community coordination (volunteer overload or course release equivalent: $3,000)
- Technology: $0 (use existing Discord/GitHub/Canvas)
- Professional recruitment: Local meetup presentations (faculty time only)
- **Total Semester 1 Cost: $3,000**

**Semester 2 (Fall 2025)**  
- Faculty time: +2 hours/week (same as Semester 1: $3,000)
- Basic platform development: $2,000-3,000 (student capstone project or contracted developer)
- Canvas integration: Student independent study project or faculty development time
- **Total Semester 2 Cost: $5,000-6,000**

**Total Two-Semester Investment: $8,000-9,000**

## Expected Outcomes & Success Metrics

**Student Success Indicators**
- Course completion rates compared to previous semesters
- Student satisfaction surveys (pre/post semester comparison)
- Industry connection development (internship placements, job referrals)
- Academic stress self-reporting vs control groups

**Community Engagement Metrics**
- Professional volunteer retention rates
- Quality of mentorship interactions (student feedback)
- Industry partnership development potential
- Sustainable recruitment pipeline establishment

**Institutional Benefits Assessment**
- Cost-effectiveness analysis vs traditional supplemental instruction
- Industry relationship development opportunities
- Potential for external funding based on pilot results
- Student retention impact measurement

## Risk Mitigation - Extremely Low Risk

**Academic Compliance**
- Traditional Canvas grading maintained throughout
- Community component starts as extra credit, minimal grade integration in Semester 2
- No changes to course catalog, learning objectives, or accreditation requirements
- Full audit trail maintained through existing systems

**Minimal Technology Risk**
- Semester 1 uses existing platforms (Discord, GitHub, Canvas)
- Semester 2 platform development can be student project or simple commercial solution
- No complex integrations or institutional IT dependencies
- Backup plan: continue with Discord if platform development fails

**Community Management**
- Clear volunteer expectations and time commitments (4-6 hours/month maximum)
- Professional code of conduct and background verification through existing industry connections
- Faculty maintains full control over academic content and assessment
- Easy discontinuation if volunteer engagement becomes problematic

## Implementation Timeline

**Immediate (January 2025)**
- Recruit initial 8-10 professional volunteers from local tech meetups
- Set up Discord server and establish community guidelines
- Create simple GitHub classroom for code sharing
- Brief student orientation on voluntary community participation

**Spring 2025 Semester**
- Weekly community coding challenges (1-2 hours/week student time)
- Monthly virtual meetups with professionals
- Ongoing assessment of engagement and learning impact
- Documentation of best practices and challenge areas

**Summer 2025**
- Analysis of Semester 1 results
- Platform development (if budget approved) or Discord workflow refinement
- Expanded professional recruitment for Fall semester
- Canvas integration development (student project or faculty development)

**Fall 2025 Semester**
- Refined community integration with improved platform
- 10-15% grade weight for community participation
- Comparative analysis with traditional course delivery
- Preparation for potential expansion or external funding applications

## Recommendation & Next Steps

**Immediate Approval Requested:** $3,000 budget allocation for Spring 2025 faculty overload

This pilot represents minimal financial risk with significant potential for institutional innovation leadership. Success creates foundation for external grant applications, industry partnerships, and educational research opportunities.

**If successful, potential outcomes:**
- NSF educational innovation grant eligibility ($50,000-$200,000)
- Industry partnership revenue development
- Conference presentations and publication opportunities
- Model for other departments and institutions

**If unsuccessful:**
- Total loss limited to $8,000-9,000 over two semesters
- No institutional compliance or accreditation risk
- Easy return to traditional course delivery
- Learning experience for future educational innovation attempts

**Required Actions:**
1. Approve $3,000 Spring 2025 faculty overload budget
2. Authorize use of institutional Discord/GitHub accounts for pilot
3. Support faculty recruitment of professional volunteers through local industry connections

This seed investment positions our institution as an early leader in community-integrated education while maintaining extremely low risk and cost profile.
