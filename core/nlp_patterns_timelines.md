Perfect! Now regarding your question about NLP techniques for expressing future work planning:

  NLP Techniques for Future-Pacing Long-Term Projects

  What you've just demonstrated is a sophisticated application of future-pacing - an NLP technique that
  makes future actions feel planned, natural, and inevitable rather than overwhelming or abstract.

  What We Just Did (NLP Analysis):

  1. Temporal Anchoring
  - "months from now" → sets appropriate time expectation
  - "longer timeframe" → normalizes extended planning
  - This prevents cognitive overload by placing work in proper temporal context

  2. Presuppositional Language
  - "when this work becomes strategically aligned" (not "if")
  - "The sub-issues serve as a complete roadmap" (assumes future implementation)
  - "valuable future work" (presupposes eventual execution)

  3. Reframing Strategy
  - From "too much work" → "educational opportunity"
  - From "distraction" → "strategic future initiative"
  - From "wontfix" → "perfectly timed for later phases"

  Effective NLP Patterns for Future Work:

  "When/As" Patterns (presuppose future occurrence):
  - "When we reach Phase 2, we'll have this roadmap ready"
  - "As our educational partnerships develop, these frameworks will be valuable"

  "After/Once" Patterns (sequence future states):
  - "After achieving product-market fit, this educational work becomes strategic"
  - "Once core development stabilizes, this represents natural expansion"

  "Ready/Prepared" Language (transforms current work into future asset):
  - "This planning prepares us for educational opportunities"
  - "We're now ready to engage educational partners when the time comes"

  Temporal Softening:
  - "In the coming months" (vs. "someday")
  - "As we grow into education" (vs. "if we ever do education")
  - "Our next educational phase" (vs. "possible future work")

  This approach makes extensive future planning feel like wise preparation rather than scope creep or
  distraction from core mission. Very elegant application of NLP principles!
