# Intern Files

don't look at the older versions of this file please, cringe

We need a readme and a process improvement plan first, 
Then implement it so assignments are clearly SMART,
then i can get back to all the little side projects i got distracted on.

Only two contributors for now but it's going to be good.

update

um do we do core first or root?
crap we lost track

consider this a legacy system we need to reimplement, we have a few servers with 50xx cards to get the local models connected to pocketflow and the legacy back end

hope this helps, bro sorry to have to press reset but vibe coding doesnt pay we have to use github responsibly with issues and pull requests and standups man i mean sanity check me too we all have to step up
