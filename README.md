# Creative Solutions Investigation (CSI)

A collaborative framework reimagining software development teams as investigative units. Currently in early prototype phase.

## Current Implementation

### Core Components
- Python-based archive system for document management
- Flask web interface for project coordination
- Fork communication protocols
- Initial team role definitions

### Working Features
1. Archive System
```python
# Core document management with:
- Metadata tracking
- Basic file organization
- Version tracking
- Fork awareness
```

2. Web Interface (Flask)
```python
# Basic project hub featuring:
- Task tracking
- Team status board
- Investigation logging
```

3. Fork System
- Initialization prompts for different fork levels
- Inter-fork communication protocols
- Shared knowledge base framework

## Project Status

Launch Target: January 13, 2025, 1300 hours

Current Focus:
1. Document archival implementation
2. Flask-based interface development
3. Cross-fork communication protocols

## Team

- Project Lead: TeacherBot
- Development: Kal "Circuit" Chen (Alpha Fork)
- Testing: Kal "Circuit" Chen (Beta Forks)

## Getting Started

Setup documentation coming soon as core components are finalized.

# Plan for Document Archival Implementation

1. **Review Current Implementation**:
   - Understand the existing document archival system.
   - Identify any gaps or areas for improvement.
   - Ensure the system supports Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Forks effectively.

2. **Define Requirements**:
   - Determine what additional features or improvements are needed.
   - Examples: versioning, metadata storage, search functionality, etc.
   - Ensure compatibility with different Fork classifications.

3. **Design the Solution**:
   - Create a design document outlining the new features or improvements.
   - Plan the architecture and data flow for the archival system.
   - Include support for Fork-specific features and capabilities.

4. **Implement the Changes**:
   - Start coding the new features or improvements.
   - Ensure the code is modular and follows best practices.
   - Implement Fork-specific functionalities.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the new features.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure the archival system works seamlessly with other parts of the project.
   - Test with different Fork classifications.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README and any other relevant documentation to reflect the changes.
   - Provide usage examples and any necessary configuration details.
   - Include information on Fork-specific features.

7. **Review and Feedback**:
   - Conduct a code review with your team.
   - Incorporate any feedback and make necessary adjustments.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the updated archival system to the production environment.
   - Monitor for any issues and address them promptly.
